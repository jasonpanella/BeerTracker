Hocus Pocus,1,4.5,"Our take on a classic summer ale.  A toast to weeds, rays, and summer haze.  A light, crisp ale for mowing lawns, hitting lazy fly balls, and communing with nature, Hocus Pocus is offered up as a summer sacrifice to clodless days.

Its malty sweetness finishes tart and crisp and is best apprediated with a wedge of orange."

Full Moon Winter Ale,1,5.6,This full-bodied ale is brewed with roasted malts and a hint of Dark Belgian sugar for a perfectly balanced taste.
Odell IPA,1,7,"We took the traditional IPA, originally shipped from England to India in the 1700's, and made it bolder and more flavorful - American Style. We've added new varieties of highly aromatic American hops to create a distinctive bitterness profile and an incredible hop character."
Ornery Amber Lager,1,0,Ornery Amber is brewed with a blend of the finest European hops and gently roasted malts.
Cutthroat Porter,1,4.8,"Not quite a stout but definitely no lightweight, Cutthroat Porter is smooth and robust. Inspired by the classic London porters, we use dark roasted malts to create a deep, rich color and flavor that hint at chocolate and coffee. We named it Cutthroat Porter as our tribute to the Colorado state fish - with its own rich heritage and unmistakable dark coloring. And while we're big fans of small batches, here's to the currently threatened Cutthroat population reaching mass quantities."
Maple Nut Brown Ale Ale,1,0,Maple syrup is added to each barrel of Maple Nut Brown Ale to impart roasted sweetness balancing the nut flavor produced by chocolate malts.

Quelque Chose,1,8,"Quelque Chose was launched in January 1996. This versatile beer was specifically developed as a winter beer because, when warmed to 70ÂºC (160ÂºF), it can be taken as a hot drink. On the other hand, on the rocks, it is a wonderful aperitif. The cherries are soaked for months in slightly bitter ale before being blended into the beer. Quelque Chose is made with dark roasted malts, and the end result is something commonly known as an authentic nectar. The most original of the Unibroue line, it is highly appreciated by winter-sports enthusiasts."

Furious Beer,1,6,"Like Hops? You'll like this fire-hued beer. This is the beer I have always dreamed of making. This is the beer that would come to mind while spending the last two years tearing down walls, hanging sheetrock, moving kegs, power washing the ceilings, arguing with various agencies, and cutting the water main. 

Without Golden Promise malt, made by family-owned Simpsons Malt, Furious would just be pissed off-ed. From Scotland, this malt is still produced in the tradition of turning over the barley by hand, resulting in a malt that is unsurpassed in its quality. Golden Promise is also used extensively by premium whisky distilleries such as The Macallan. This malt provides the backbone for the intense hop character. Four American hop varieties are used at a rate of over three pounds per barrel. The result is a rich malt sweetness infused with bright hop flavor and aroma from beginning to end. Oh yeah, it's about 6% alcohol and around 100 IBUs."
Bender Beer,1,5.1,"This beer is an amalgamation of styles; brown/porter/apa. Five distinct malts, including two from Belgium, give this beer added complexity and depth. We also add oatmeal to this beer to give it a smooth texture not usually associated with this type of beer. We add large amounts of American finishing hops to give Bender a citrus hop aroma because... we like hops. This is a session beer weighing in around 5% alcohol and 25 IBUs. Grab one today, we think you will want another!"

Buzzsaw Brown,1,4.8,"By 1915, Bend, Oregon, was alive with the sound of the buzz saw, as two of the country's largest pine sawmills set up shop on the banks of the Deschutes River.  The mills are  gone now, but the smokestacks still stand testament to Bend's humble beginnings. 

Buzzsaw Brown is an easy-drinking beer that is refreshing after a hard dayâ€™s work. The timber mills in Bend may be closed, but whether your adventure includes a day of scaling rock faces, hitting 18 holes or skiing the slopes in spring, Buzzsaw Brown is the perfect end to a fun-filled day.

â€œBuzzsaw Brown is one of my favorite beers,â€ says Deschutes Brewery Brewmaster Larry Sidor. â€œThe unique combination of European and American malts makes it a very food friendly beer that pairs well with a wide variety of flavors.â€"

Geist Bock,1,6.1,"This is one of our rare lagers brewed in the style of the German Heiliges Geist Bock, or Holy Ghost Bock. The name refers to the lighter nature of the beer as opposed to the darker and heavier Doppel Bock and Mai Bock also brewed during the spring in Germany. There is a rich malt flavor, a firm German style lager head, and a clean lagered finish to this beer.  Available on draft or in 12 oz. bottles."

Dark Ale,1,4.5,"A dark brew full of promise. Coopers Dark Ale is a journey in taste, starting fresh and creamy, and finishing with a lingering coffee flavour. 

Conditioned and naturally brewed using the top fermentation method, Coopers 'Dark' is made using roasted and chocolate malts, giving it a rich dark colour and unique flavour. 

Coopers Dark Ale has no additives and no preservatives."
Cinder Cone Red,1,5.4,"Cinder Cone Red's diverse selection of hops and barley captivates thirsty palates with its toffee-like flavor, intense citrus aroma and defined bitterness.

Located on the northern slope of Mt. Bachelor, the Cinder Cone was also known as \Red Hill\"" due to its reddish color that is revealed as the seasons change"

90 Shilling,1,5.3,"We introduced 90 Shilling, our flagship beer, at our opening party in 1989. For a while, we'd been wondering - what would happen if we lightened up the traditional Scottish ale? The result is an irresistibly smooth and delicious medium-bodied amber ale. The name 90 Shilling comes from the Scottish method of taxing beer. Only the highest quality beers were taxed 90 Shillings. A shilling was a British coin used from 1549 to 1982. We think you'll find this original ale brilliantly refreshing, and worth every shilling."
Sunshine Wheat,1,4.8,"SUNSHINE WHEAT is a great beer for trouncing thirst.  Yet, it has a depth of character that inspires a quiet momentâ€™s reflection. Sunshine Wheat swirls in the mouth with ripples of coriander and orange peel tartness, settling nicely into a tranquil sea of apple and honey tones.  A filtered wheat beer, Sunshine offers a crisp, refreshing alternative to heavier-bodied heffe-weizens."

Denver Pale Ale / DPA,1,5.4,"Historically Great Divideâ€™s flagship beer, DPAâ€™s record speaks for itself. By continually garnering national and international recognition, DPA has risen to become one of the most award-winning English-style pale ales in the world.

Sporting a brilliant copper hue and an assertive floral hop aroma, DPA is known for its smooth, malty middle, which is expertly complemented with hearty and complex hop flavor. DPAâ€™s extraordinary hop finish is marked by crisp yet moderate hop bitterness. Its well-balanced profile makes DPA the perfect beer to accompany a hearty mountain picnic or a night on the town. For those who seek beers characterized by excitement, flavor and distinction, Denver Pale Ale is the natural choice."

Then we let the finishing hops shine, for a beer that's crisp instead of bitter, as many ambers are. Levity was named by our brewers partly for its light color - and partly for the way it just refuses to take itself too seriously. Hey, we could all use a little levity once in a while."
Easy Street Wheat,1,4.6,"Light and refreshing, Easy Street Wheat is an unfiltered American-style wheat beer. Leaving in the yeast gives the beer a nice, smooth finish and a slightly citrusy flavor. Easy Street Wheat gets its name by brewers \taking it easy\"" and not filtering the beer. However"
Boulevard Pale Ale,1,5.4,"Boulevard Pale Ale is a smooth, fruity, well-balanced beer with year-round appeal.

Pauwel Kwak,1,8,"LOOK:
Kwak is recognisable by its deep bright amber colour and a dense, creamy coloured head. The pale wood of the glass holder makes a pleasant contrast with the beer.

SMELL:
You will smell a mellow, fruity and malty aroma with a slightly spicy character (coriander, hops). Additional earthy and very subtle aromas of banana and perhaps also a whiff of pineapple or mango in the background.

TASTE:
Discover a very mellow, fruity attack, a nougat-like solidity, and a slightly spicy character with hints of liquorice passing into a warm finish that reminds you of caramelised banana. The bitterness always remains in the background but in the end emerges delicately."

Samichlaus Bier 2005,1,14,
Barleywine,1,10,"Our American-style Barleywine undergoes a three hour boil to intensify the caramel malts and the enormous Pacific Northwest hop charge. The result is a rich, estery brew with toffee notes and citrus hop flavors layered throughout. Enjoy this brew fresh today or lay it down for aging to see how the flavors of each vintage evolve."

Aventinus Weizen-Eisbock,1,12,
Aventinus Weizenstarkbier / Doppel Weizen Bock,1,8.2,"Dark-ruby, almost black-colored and streaked with fine top-fermenting yeast, this beer has a compact and persistent head. This is a very intense wheat doppelbock with a complex spicy chocolate-like arome with a hint of banana and raisins. On the palate, you experience a soft touch and on the tongue it is very rich and complex, though fresh with a hint of caramel. It finishes in a rich soft and lightly bitter impression."
New Belgium Trippel Belgian Style Ale,1,8.5,"Our Trippel Belgian Style Ale (pronounced triple) opens with a bold blast of hops that slowly gives way to the fruity esters implied by our Belgian yeast strain. The Three Graces hand-painted on the label are Zeusâ€™s daughters Aglaia (splendor), Euphrosyne (mirth) and Thalia (good cheer). In the Belgian tradition of brewing singles, doubles and triples, Trippel is the strongest with the longest fermentation. Remarkably smooth and complex, our bottle-conditioned Trippel is spiced with a trace of coriander."
Hennepin Farmhouse Ale,1,7.7,
Abbey Belgian Style Ale,1,7,"Winner of four World Beer Cup medals and eight medals at the Great American Beer Fest, Abbey Belgian Ale is the Mark Spitz of New Belgiumâ€™s lineup - but it didnâ€™t start out that way. When Jeff and Kim first sampled the beer at the Lyons Folks Fest, reviews were mixed at best. One of founder Jeffâ€™s first two Belgian style homebrews (along with Fat Tire), Abbey is a Belgian dubbel (or double) brewed with six different malts and an authentic Belgian yeast strain. Abbey is bottle-conditioned, weighs in at 7.0% alcohol by volume, and pairs well with chocolate (or boldly served by itself) for dessert."

La Roja,1,7.2,"An artisan amber ale brewed in the Flanders tradition.  Deep amber with earthy caramel, spice, and sour fruit notes developed through natural barrel aging.  Unfiltered, unpasteurized and blended from barrels ranging in age from two to ten months."
Brother Thelonious,1,9,
Hop Trip Fresh Hop Pale Ale,1,5.5,"This Fresh Hop Pale Ale is all about celebrating the hop harvest in the fall.  Fresh picked hops have to be added to the brew immediately and in abundance.  Roughly 270 pounds of Crystal hops from Doug Weathers' farm outside Salem, Oregon will be added to the 50 barrel batch in addition to some dry kilned whole flower hops.  That adds up to approximately 5.5 pounds of hops per barrel brewed.  Another deliciously interesting beer in our Bond Street Series."

Hibernation Ale,1,8.1,"Great Divideâ€™s award-winning Hibernation Ale is Coloradoâ€™s original strong ale â€“ it has been our winter seasonal each year since 1995. Since that time, Hibernation has become the most sought-after winter beer in Colorado. Hibernationâ€™s massive flavors are so intense that it requires over three months of aging each year. Each summer, while our brewers are still spending their weekends in flip-flops and shorts, they prepare for Julyâ€™s Hibernation brewing schedule.

We cellar Hibernation until late October, when it reaches the peak of perfection. This lengthy aging process gives Hibernation its revered malty richness, complex hop profile and hearty warming character, which is perfect right out of the bottle or cellared for longer periods of time. Hibernation is a lively treat that really beats the winter chill. This scrumptious, collectible, and imminently cellarable ale is only available for six weeks each year, from November 1 to December 15.  Hibernation Ale is the perfect gift or accompaniment to your winter festivities."
Wee Heavy Winter Ale,1,0,
2Â° Below,1,6.6,"Pull on your wool socks and crack open a 2Â° Below Ale. This tasty winter warmer started life as a small batch beer brewed for the Al Johnson Uphill Downhill â€“ a telemark ski race in Crested Butte, Colorado. The Uphill Downhill celebrates the exploits of Al Johnson, letter carrier extraordinaire, who delivered mail by ski in the late 1800â€™s. Dry hopping during fermentation creates a floral nose with a hint of pepper and spicy, subtle undertones. 2Â° Below provides a bright, hoppy palate and a cheery warm afterglow."
Monkey Wrench Dark Ale,1,5.3,
Old Legover,1,4.1,
Hercules Double IPA,1,9.1,"Hoppier, maltier and with more alcohol than a standard IPA, Hercules Double IPA definitely is not for the faint of heart. Hercules Double IPA is, however, an elixir fit for the gods. A brash but creamy wonder, Hercules pours a deep orange-coppery color, forming substantial lace in the glass. Hercules Double IPA delivers a huge amount of piney, floral, and citrusy hop aroma and flavor from start to finish. A hefty backbone of nutty, toffee-like malt character balances Herculesâ€™ aggressive, punchy hop profile."
Fresh Hop Pale Ale,1,6.1,"The September hop harvest is a once-a-year opportunity to brew with fresh hops, also called â€œwet hops.â€ Given the perishable nature of just-harvested hop cones, they are shipped overnight to Great Divide shortly after harvest. The morning of the scheduled hop delivery in Denver, Great Divideâ€™s brewers begin brewing Fresh Hop and are ready to hop the beer just as the fresh hops are delivered.

Using fresh hops is a big endeavor, requiring four to five times the volume of hops compared to the usual process of using pelletized hops. This complex process brings impressive results: Fresh Hop is an American-Style Pale Ale with moderate hop bitterness marked by a unique and intensely grassy hop flavor and aroma. Fresh Hop is a superbly refreshing, medium bodied, light-copper colored pale ale."
Twisted Thistle India Pale Ale,1,6.1,
Espresso Stout,1,0,
Inversion IPA,1,6.8,"After several months of experimentation, energy and obsession, Deschutes Breweryâ€™s brewers have triumphed once again.  Inversion I.P.A.'s trio of American hops delivers an over-the-top nose with hints of orange and grapefruit.  Inversion is then dry-hopped for seven days resulting in an added hoppy kick.  To balance the hop character, Deschutesâ€™ brewers used crystal and caraston malts that weave throughout the beer providing soft, complex caramel flavors. 

Just like clear days up on the mountain, Inversion I.P.A. will deliver a path to higher ground.  Inversion I.P.A. is a phenomenal NW-style I.P.A., beckoning all beer drinkers and enticing I.P.A. lovers to invert their world and find clarity above the routine of the everyday."

With more body than a traditional Belgian pils, Blue Paddle is reflective of Europeâ€™s finest pilseners."

Peter Bouckaert, came to us from Rodenbach â€“ home of the fabled sour red. Our La Folie emulates the spontaneous fermentation beers of Peterâ€™s beloved Flanders with sour apple notes, a dry effervescence, and earthy undertones. New in 2010, we'll do a single bottling of La Folie for the year. Collect the 22oz unique to 2010 designed bottle and start a yearly wood-aged collection of goodness."
Abt 12,1,10,"The absolute top quality in the hierarchy of the St. Bernardus beers. It is also the beer with the highest alcohol content (10.50 %).
A dark ivory coloured beer with a high fermentation. 

The show piece of the brewery. Thanks to its soft and unconditionally genuine aroma, the beer can be smoothly tasted.  The Abt has a very fruity flavour."

Westmalle Trappist Tripel,1,9.5,"Was first brewed in 1934 and the recipe has not changed since 1956. It is made with pale candy sugar and has a very pale color produced from a mash of light pilsener malts. Styrian Goldings hops are used along with some German varieties and the classic Saaz pilsener hop. After a long secondary fermentation, the Tripel Westmalle is bottled with a dose of sugar and yeast. This beer holds up well in the bottle over time and seems to soften with age."

This provides the backbone for an assertive hop profile featuring organic Pacific Gem.

Organic Amber Ale,1,5,"Medium-bodied with an appealing amber hue, this is the First Ale of the Republic.

The result: Truly delicious ale that salutes organic farmers and all the goodness they bring to our tables."

Old Rasputin Russian Imperial Stout,1,9,"Produced in the tradition of 18th Century English brewers who supplied the court of Russia's Catherine the Great, Old Rasputin seems to develop a cult following wherever it goes. It's a rich, intense brew with big complex flavors and a warming finish."
Yeti Imperial Stout,1,9.5,"Traditionally, Imperial Stouts, the biggest and boldest of all stouts, were brewed with massive amounts of roasted malts and hops, resulting in a velvety smooth but robust beer characterized by high alcohol content and extremely high hop bitterness. Meeting the challenge of this aggressive, challenging beer style, Great Divideâ€™s Yeti Imperial Stout is an onslaught of the senses. An almost viscous, inky-black brew, Yeti opens with a massive, roasty, chocolate, coffee malt flavor that eventually gives way to rich toffee and burnt caramel notes. Packed with an enormous quantity of American hops, Yetiâ€™s hop profile reveals a slightly citrusy, piney, and wonderfully dry hoppy finish."

La Terrible is a dark brown beer on lees and is part of a collection of exotic and refined Unibroue beers brewed using 100% natural raw materials.

Titan IPA,1,6.8,"Traditionally India Pale Ales, the hoppiest of all pales, were brewed with more alcohol and large quantities of hops in order to survive the lengthy ocean journey from the U.K. to India. Unlike our brewing forefathers, Great Divide enjoys the modern benefits of refrigeration and we donâ€™t have any plans to ship Titan IPA to India. Instead, we brew Titan IPA for hop disciples â€“ independent beer drinkers seeking out robust, flavorful beers characterized by their abundance of hops flavor, aroma and bitterness. As a big, aggressively hopped India Pale Ale, Titan IPA fills this bill â€“ beginning with piney hop aromas and citrus hop flavors, and finishing with a rich, malty sweetness that is carefully balanced with crisp hop bitterness."
St Peter's Organic Ale,1,4.5,"Water is extracted from our own 300â€™ deep borehole and combined with Soil Association accredited light malted barley from Norfolk. Organic hops provide the distinctive palate. The yeast used is St. Peterâ€™s own single strand variety. The result is a delicate, clean, crisp, lightly carbonated, traditional English Ale with a full â€˜citrus hopâ€™ aftertaste. This lovely beer won the Soil Associationâ€™s top prize in 2002 and a silver medal in 2006."

Nokdechiloff,1,12.7,"This winter warmer will knock the chill away until summer. It used as much malt as our brew house can handle and armloads of fresh hops and lovingly laid in our fermentor for four months. Massively malty and balanced with burly bitterness it is truly the king of beers, approaching wine in strength. A definitive one to have when youâ€™re only having one. Adoringly served in brandy snifters to preserve precious properties."
California Dreaming,1,8,"Imperial, or super IPAâ€™s were spawned out of the fascination of hops by the American consumer and are beyond Pale Ales and IPAâ€™S in terms of both hop and alcohol content. Our interpretation is orange-gold in color, lightly bitter but highly hoppy with a firm malt backbone. 
Weâ€™ll gladly put this head-to-head with the best that those California Hophead/Brewers have to offer."
Manayunk Lager,1,6.4,"In strict accordance with the German purity law of 1516, we present to you this annually brewed festbier. Traditionally brewed in March and stored deep in the caves of Germany, this beer was brought to the masses to celebrate in October. It is a Vienna-style lager with a bit more malt and hops making a malty but balanced beverage. Copper-orange in color, it sports a toasty malt backbone that wonderfully compliments itself with many of our menu items."
Brilliant Barstool,1,5.1,"A true English session ale brewed in the pale ale style using ye olde techniques of yesteryear. Specially crafted to inspire you and your thirstiest mates barstool conversations. Light copper in colour. This pint is quite malty with just enough East Kent hops for a nice, earthy hoppiness. Naturally cask conditioned, this may be served a little cold for a true Brit but is a 
complimentary double nod to one of the 1st beer styles. Cheers mate!"
Krooks Mill,1,5.3,"A well-balanced, hoppy American style pale ale with a generous usage of Caramel and Crystal malts. This beer is amber in color and is finished
with fresh Cascade, Columbus and Mt. Hood hops from the Pacific Northwest for a wonderful floral aroma. World Beer Cup Bronze Medal winner and a Perennial favorite here at the Brewery. Also available in bottles to go."

As it is the case with Champagne, the bottles are placed in a â€œpupitreâ€ with results in an additional fermentation.

Smoked Porter,1,5.9,"Stone Smoked Porter is dark, rich and complicated. A porter is substantially darker than a pale ale, but not as black or opaque as a stout. Our Smoked porter has a captivatingly deep mahogany color, complimented by silky dark tan head. Rich, full bodied and robust. Smooth, with chocolate and coffee-like flavors balanced by the subtle \smoky\"" character of just the right amount of peat-smoked specialty malt."""
Stone Pale Ale,1,5.4,"Our flagship ale, Stone Pale Ale is our Southern California interpretation of the classic British pale ale style. Deep amber in color, Stone Pale Ale is robust and full flavored. A delicate hop aroma is complemented by a rich maltiness. This is an ale for those who have learned to appreciate distinctive flavor. Stone Pale Ale is great by itself, or with food that requires a beer of character."

Another one of FiftyFifty's seasonals, the Roundabout Oatmeal Stout is brown to black in color and nearly opaque. It has a velvet like mouthfeel, moderate hints of dark dried fruit, espresso beans and Dark Chocolate... and just a hint of hop bitterness. The addition of Flaked Oats gives this brew its wonderful creamy texture. Roundabout Oatmeal Stout is one of a series of Stouts that FiftyFifty Brewing Co. will produce during the course of the year.

From Spike: Iron Tankard â€œOld Stock Aleâ€ is the first of four beers in Terrapinâ€™s Georgia Theatre Sessions. It is brewed with a generous portion of crystal malts for a full body and is lightly hopped. This malt forward beer has flavors of dark dried fruit, mellow alcoholic warmth and is unfiltered for your listening pleasure.

A portion of the proceeds will be donated to the Georgia Historic Trust for Historic Preservation Fund to rebuild the Georgia Theater. To make things even more interesting, there is one Golden Ticket hidden among each of the Georgia Theater Sessions brews. This means that four lucky winners will receive a lifetime pass to the new Theater."

Manifesto has a restrained malt backbone of flavor with mild biscuit and caramel notes, and the hop character is light to moderate with mild earthiness evolving to a slightly more moderate citrus/piney finish.

Racer 5 IPA,1,7,"This is a hoppy IPA. Did I say hops? Your brewer is a hop head! This is a full bodied beer using American grains. The goal was to create a base for showing off the unique floral qualities of two Pacific Northwest hops, Columbus and Cascade. Columbus is a new hybrid High Alpha Acid hop used mostly for bittering, but used heavily as an aromatic in this strong brew. Cascade is the balance that ties the malt and bittering hops together. It is a true specialty ale and is our brewer's statement on this style."

Some unique flavors come forth in the malt character. ...Louisiana sweet molasses and dark brown sugar. This dark brew is well hopped with Chinook and Cascade hops, which are somewhat, masked by the malt. This is a balanced bold brew boasting an A.V.B. of 8.1% that can creep up on you, \so don't get mauled\"". It has a dry roasted quality that masks its' high alchohol content"

1554 Enlightened Black Ale,1,5.5,"Born of a flood and centuries-old Belgian text, 1554 Enlightened Black Ale uses a light lager yeast strain and dark chocolaty malts to redefine what dark beer can be. In 1997, a Fort Collins flood destroyed the original recipe our researcher, Phil Benstein, found in the library. So Phil and brewmaster, Peter Bouckaert, traveled to Belgium to retrieve this unique style lost to the ages. Their first challenge was deciphering antiquated script and outdated units of measurement, but trial and error (and many months of in-house sampling) culminated in 1554, a highly quaffable dark beer with a moderate body and mouthfeel."

John Barleycorn Barleywine Style Ale,1,9,"Our Seasonal Offering. We honor the Harvest & Holidays each year by brewing a traditional Barleywine style ale, using a variety of ingredients. The Label, created by local artist Janis Taylor, is a folksy woodcut based on the tale of John Barleycorn in verse.

Brewed in small 10-barrel batches with Certified Organic barley malt, this crimson hued ale has a sweet caramel nose with a zesty spicy, citrus taste. It has a slight hop finish and leaves a warm, tingling sensation on the tongue. A great winter warmer!

While they vary in size, shape and color, each shanty contains an enthusiast braving the cold; spinning their tall tales; staring deeply into that hole in the ice; and, of course, enjoying a Legendary Wisconsin Beer. Brewed in the fall to help you survive our Wisconsin winters.

Shantytown Doppelbock is brewed in the style of a German Doppelbock. Brown in color with malty sweetness and a full body."

Tripel Karmeliet is a very refi ned and complex golden-to-bronze brew with a fantastic creamy head. These characteristics derive not only from the grains used but also from restrained hopping with Styrians and the fruity nature (banana and vanilla) of the house yeast.

SMELL:
Very refined and complex. Hints of vanilla mixed with citrus aromas.

TASTE:
Tripel Karmeliet has not only the lightness and freshness of wheat, but also the creaminess of oats together with a spicy lemony almost quinine
dryness."

Red MacGregor,1,5,"Red Macgregor is a unique beer: delicate and sophisticated yet the robust cask conditioned version of this beer was the first Scottish beer to win the BIIA World Cask Beer Gold Medal.

On the nose, this ruby-red beer is delicate, floral and fruity, with notes of violets, cherries, toffee and caramel. 

On the palate, the fruits combine with a juicy malt character and hints of toasted malt, with a biscuit malt and spicy hop finish."

Multiple additions of German Hallertauer hops are used to achieve this delicate flavor. We use a special KÃ¶lsch yeast, an ale yeast that ferments at lager temperatures, to yield the slightly fruity, clean flavor of this beer. Fancy Lawnmower Beer is a world class brew yet light enough to be enjoyed by Texans after strenuous activities, like mowing the lawn.

Big Eye IPA,1,6,"ndia Pale Ale is a style of beer that was developed in England during the period of the British Empire. It is derived from bitter ales but contains even more alcohol and hops. This helped preserve the beer on its long sea journey around Cape Hope to India.

British troops returning from India brought their love of this beer back with them so breweries began brewing it for the home market as well. Sadly, the style had mostly died out in England by the late twentieth century.

American home brewers began to brew I.P.A. because of their love for the intense hoppiness of the style. In time American I.P.A.s became much more aggressively bitter and hoppy than their historical predecessors.

Big Eye I.P.A. is our version of this wonderful style.  American Centennial hops are  used exclusively to bitter, flavor, finish, and dry hop the Big Eye. Its full hop flavor is guaranteed to please the palate of the true hop head."

Gubna Imperial IPA,1,10,"Emphasizing that complexity of character can arise from simple elements, this ale is made with three malts and one hop. Its light amber color and slightly spicy malt character are derived from the use of German Dark Munich Malt and Rye Malt respectively. North American 2-row barley combines with the other grains to lay the foundation for the hop onslaught to come. Summit hops are used exclusively in the boil for bitterness, flavor and aroma but it doesnâ€™t end there. Post-fermentation dry hopping allows the 9.5% ABV monstrosity to gently coax the citrus rind and grapefruit aroma to join the 100 IBUs already present. This beer should greet you with a pungent citrus blast, provide a spicy yet round middle and finish with a brisk, clean bitterness."

The spiciness of the Hallertau Mittelfruh and Spalt Spalter hops balance out the slightly sweet character of our breweryâ€™s own signature wheat malt, resulting in a crisp and refreshing wheat beer with a subtle lemon aroma and flavor."

A complex malt character is created by combining five different types of malts. It has a rich, creamy head with a fine lace. The light fruitiness, characteristic of ales, is derived from a proprietary yeast strain.

On the palate, rich and complex with sweet toasted malt, molasses, fresh and dried fruit and hints of warming spices."

The light fruitiness is derived from a KÃ¶lsch yeast strain. A chill haze may be present, which is a characteristic of wheat beers.

Samuel Adams Cranberry Lambic,1,5.9,"Samuel Adams Cranberry Lambic is a fruit beer that draws its flavor not just from the cranberries it is brewed with, but also from the unique fermentation character imparted by the rare wild yeast strain. The result is a flavor rich in fruitiness and reminiscent of cranberries and bananas, cloves and nutmeg. The yeast fermentation also will create a slight sourness on the sides of the palate, a signature of the original Lambic style which, with the subtle cereal note from the wheat malt, remind its drinker that, as fruity a beer as this is, it is still a beer."

HopBack Amber Ale,1,5.6,"TrÃ¶egs Breweryâ€™s Flagship beer, HopBack Amber Ale derives its name from a vessel in the brewhouse called a hopback. As the â€˜wortâ€™ is being transferred from the brewhouse to fermentation it passes through the hopback vessel. Packed full of fresh whole flower hops, the wort slowly circulates through this vessel extracting the essence of the aromatic hops. This vessel adds more time and more hop character that creates a fresh, spicy taste and rich caramel note that defines this signature ale.

Dead Reckoning is unfiltered and weighs in at 5.8% abv and 53 IBUâ€™s.

When India was part of the British Empire, pale ale shipped to the troops would often spoil due to the rough voyage and temperature extremes. The brewers had a theory that if they loaded the beer with extra hops, the hops would preserve the beer. Of course, this added significantly to the beerâ€™s flavor and aroma. When the troops returned to Britain, they had become \hop-heads\"""

Abbey Roade Belgian Ale,1,6.4,"Abbey Roade is brewed in the tradition of the famous Belgian Abbey-style ales.  This wonderful brew is soft and sweet up front.  The complex and spicy middle palate is in most part due to the generous addition of dark Belgian candy sugar.  This semi-dry ale has notes of ripe plum and pear with a peppery finish.

The KÃ¶lner Dom (Cologne Cathedral), is one of the best-known architectural monuments in Germany and has been Cologne's most famous landmark since its completion in the late 19th century. True KÃ¶lsch can only be brewed if the brewery has a view of this famous cathedral, thus itsâ€™ appearance on our tap markers."
Kipona Fest,1,5.2,"This Oktoberfest style Marzen is a favorite at the famous Bavarian fall beer festivals. The distinct toasted malt flavor of this amber lager finishes quite crisp due to the extensive lagering of this beer. One sip and youâ€™ll swear youâ€™re in Munich.

\Kipona\"" is the Indian word for \""sparkling water\"". Each year"
Trail Blaze Organic Brown Ale,1,5.3,"Trail Blaze Organic American Brown Ale exhibits a beautiful deep copper color and an evident hop bitterness & aroma.  This is balanced against roasted caramel-like characteristics and hints of chocolate.

This style was developed by our Brewmaster to have the perfect carbonation and crispness on our summerâ€™s hot and humid Pennsylvania days."
Coconut Porter,1,0,"Based on the winning Homebrew Contest entry by John Slotterback and Fred Rogers, this dark, roasty porter is infused with fresh coconut which produces a sweet finish.  The coconut balances the chocolaty notes, producing a taste not unlike German chocolate cake in a glass! This will be brewed in Camp Hill and distributed in limited quantity to Harrisburg and Gettysburg."
Wildflower Honey Wheat,1,0,"This American wheat beer is infused with 20% wildflower honey resulting in a light, semi-sweet refreshing beverage.

Wonderfully balanced with a clean, velvety, slightly fruity taste, AutumnFest is the perfect beer for the Fall- a nice transition between the lighter beers of summer and the darker, heavier winter brews. It's a favorite of many Weyerbacher aficionados, who anticipate the end of summer with this wonderful beer. 

   Weyerbacher AutumnFest ( ABV 5.4%) is generally available in stores August through December.  Pick up a case to celebrate the change of seasons. Prost!"
Black Hole,1,7,"Coming in at an ABV of 7.0%, Our Black Hole satisfies the transition from dark ale to stout. We think of this as slightly \Porter-ish\"" with a strong malt body and a very light hop finish. This is brewed year round and is available in Pennsylvania in the regular Variety Pack.  This will help the ale drinker among us maintain their own balance!"""
Blanche,1,5,"Clean, refreshing and perhaps just a bit tart, our brewers developed Weyerbacher Blanche just after their trip to Belgium during the winter of 2000.  Blanche, meaning \white\"""
Blasphemy,1,11.8,"First released in March 2007,  Blasphemy is our award winning QUAD aged in bourbon barrels.  But not overaged, so we've picked up gentle vanilla oaky notes which complement rather than supercede the complex qualities that already make QUAD such an incredible beer.  Expected to be an annual Spring seasonal, supplies are limited.  ABV is 11.8%."
Blithering Idiot,1,11.1,"At Weyerbacher, we prefer to brew things true to European style guidelines. Consequently our barley wine is  on the malty side, yet not  overly sweet. Notes of date or perhaps fig on the palate follow a pleasurably malty aroma to your taste buds. The finish is warm and fruity, and begs for the next sip.

Enjoy Blithering Idiot in a brandy snifter or wine glass, preferably in front of the fire, or accompanying a literary classic. This is the finest life has to offer and should be treated as such. Moments of reflection make all the toil worthwhile, and Blithering Idiot is for moments like these. Share it with your family over the holiday dinner. Lay a few down, aging only helps a barley wine develop more class. At 11.1 % ABV (alcohol by volume) this fine ale will keep for years. Our expected maximum shelf-life is 2 to 3 years. Although it might see a decade, beyond the 3rd year most barley-wines have a tendency to decrease in complexity, so don't wait too long"
Decadence,1,13,"Decadence is our Tenth Anniversay spiced amber ale.  This is a very limited production, brewed only once, to celebrate ten fantastic years in business.  This ale weighs in at 13% ABV and is a fantastic sipper, especially after dinner or consider paring it with a good book on a cool fall evening.  Decadence is brewed with honey, cardamom spice and gentian (a rare botanical!)  This ale is very unique and will develop finer character when aged at cellar temperatures."
Oatmeal Stout,1,5.5,Pours a very deep black with a pleasant aroma and a thick brown head.  It has the usual coffee taste you would expect with a hint of chocolate.  There is quite a lot of carbonation but is very drinkable.
Double Simcoe IPA,1,9,"Double Simcoe IPA, 9.0% abv, is our incredible reward for Hopheads seeking over the top flavor in a Double IPA, without the harshness. Brewed  with Simcoe hops, developed and trademarked by Select Botanicals Group, LLC, in the year 2000. This hybrid hops was created to allow maximum aromatic oils, along with low cohumulone(harshness) levels, so that brewers can really load up a lot of 'em in a beer and not have any harshness. The piney, citrusy notes are all here, and in a very clean (non-harsh) way, as well as having an aroma with impact. Introduced by Weyerbacher in 2005 originally as a seasonal, this brew has garnered numbers so high on Beer Advocate, and been in such high demand by consumers,  we decided to add it to our year-round line-up in March 2007. Check it out, and you'll soon see why everyone's talking about it."
Eleven,1,11.7,"Our Eleventh anniversy ale, released in July 2006 only is a Triple IPA made exclusively with Phoenix hops. 11.7% abv make this Triple IPA powerful, but the Phoenix hops keep it smooth.  Phoenix is another one of those hops with low cohumulone levels, which means  when used in very large quantities (as we do in Eleven) the hops flavor is very smooth, not a hint of harshness for the enormous amounts of hops in the brew.  As with all of our Anniversay ales, this one will age fantastically and will never be made again, as each anniversary is an entirely different brew."
Heresy,1,8,"This incredibly intriguing Imperial Stout is made by aging our Old Heathen in some very famous Oak barrels that were used for aging bourbon! What do we have when we are done? A stout whose very essence has been enhanced. A stout whose complexity has been increased. A stout with notes of Oak, whiskey and vanilla melding together to create a new sensation. Have we gone too far this time? We don't think so. Heresy is a step above and a leap beyond the extraordinary. Taste it and see what everyone is talking about. 8.0% ABV"
Hops Infusion,1,6.2,"Hops Infusion is loaded with piney, citrusy notes, much hops complexity, and a strong foundation of malt underneath it all.. Glowing a deep amber color, Hops Infusion is brewed with seven types of hops. Simcoe, Magnum, Cascade, Liberty, Saaz, Fuggles and E. Kent Goldings give this beer the complexity that's so interesting. Our brewers intention on Hops Infusion was to create a complexity of hops flavor and aromas, not found in any other beer.

Originally developed for our BrewPub (no longer open), Hops Infusion was ahead of its time in 1998, but eventually became over shadowed by plethora of entries from other brewers in the India Pale Ale category, with everyone pushing the envelope on hops content more and more. So, in late 2005 we redesigned this beer with an entirely new recipe and new packaging as well. The results are unmistakable, Hops Infusion is clearly a leading IPA once again.

We brew Hops Infusion (6.2% ABV, 1.068 OG) all year 'round. So if your local beer store doesn't have it, tell 'em to get moving!"
House Ale,1,4.5,"House Ale, our 4.5% session ale, was first brewed in 2006.  Our goal was to brew a beer that was a little bit lower in alcohol, but did not lack for body and flavor. We're sure you'll agree, that's just what we achieved with this tasty brew.  Brewed with Pale, Caramunich, and Carapils malt for flavor and body, then hopped exclusively with expensive Tettnang hops, a very delicate, delicious hops that perfectly fits this beer with just the right snap of flavor.   Available only in Pennsylvania, in our Variety Pack Case."
Imperial Pumpkin Ale,1,8,"Yes that's right!  The mother of all Pumpkin Ales is currently in transit to our wholesalers and should be out on shelves around mid-September.  This 8.0% ABV pumpkin ale is heartier, spicier, and more \caramelly\"" and \""pumpkiny\"" than its faint brethren!  
  Perfect finisher on a cool autumn night"
Insanity,1,11.1,"Insanity, just released this past November, 2004, is Weyerbacher's latest creation in the world of cutting edge beers. Insanity is made by aging our perfectly balanced Blithering Idiot Barleywine in  oak bourbon casks. This incredible combination creates a melange of flavors such as malt, dates, oak, vanilla, and bourbon just to name a few.

  Insanity is 11.1% ABV. It is best enjoyed in a brandy snifter and served at 45-50 degrees F."
Muse Farmhouse Ale,1,6.2,"Muse, a Farmhouse Ale,  is brewed \somewhat\"" in the tradition of the style"
Old Heathen,1,8,"Rich, velvety and deliciously complex, Old Heathen is a truly distinctive winter warmer. We use seven types of malt and two varieties of hops to bring forth this big brew. Quite robust and roasty on the palate, Old Heathen imperial stout has a wonderfully fruity nose and a moderately dry finish. The taste is highly complex- perhaps you'll even discern notes of espresso or chocolate. 

Old Heathen imperial stout is our interpretation of a beer style that originated in the 18th century. Brewed in England and exported to Germany, Scandinavia and Russia, these beers became fashionable among the members of the Czar's court. In order to survive long voyages they were brewed with high alcohol content to prevent spoilage. And at 8.0% ABV (alcohol by volume) Old Heathen definitely contains a warming belt. You may want to lay down a few bottles for future evaluation- this beer keeps well and will only get better with age.

Like most of our beers, Weyerbacher Old Heathen is a perfect accompaniment to foods. Try it with rich stews, oysters, caviar or roasted meats. Old Heathen is also a perfect companion to chocolate desserts.

Old Heathen is now available year-round."
Prophecy,1,9.3,"Prophecy is our third ale to be aged in bourbon barrels. We've taken our Merry Monks' Ale and carefully aged it in bourbon barrels. The result is a fabulous unique ale, softened with hints of vanilla and oak, with an intriguing finish to it. Prophecy is a limited release so when it's here, be sure to grab a case or two to lay away before its gone. 9.3% ABV."
Quad,1,11.8,"Grand Champion in the 2000, and again in 2004 at United States Beer Tasting Championship, Weyerbacher QUAD is the first quadrupel style beer to be commercially brewed and bottled in the United States.

In December 2002 QUAD won Mid-Atlantic Champion at the USBTC for the third year in a row.

Massively big and delicious, QUAD is an elegant and dark ale. Rich with complexity and flavor, try savoring it after a long day or during a fine dinner. You also might enjoy it as an aperitif or as an accompaniment to a dessert, but QUAD stands alone quite well. We recommend enjoying QUAD in a brandy snifter or wineglass so you can drink in the aroma of this fine elixir. QUAD, with an alcohol content of 11.8% (by volume) is the strongest beer we make, so please pay proper accord as you enjoy it.

As with any higher alcohol beers, QUAD will be at its best after a period of 6 or 12 months in the bottle, perhaps longer. We expect a shelf life of 3-5 years, but go ahead, we know you can't wait (we couldn't either). Enjoy one now, and another every month or two, and you'll be truly amazed as QUAD gains smoothness and complexity over time as it ages."
Raspberry Imperial Stout,1,8,"Enjoyed alone as a winter-warmer or as the perfect finish to any fine meal, our Raspberry Imperial Stout is a wonderfully full-flavored beer with just a \kiss\"" of raspberry flavor. 
When we brew this beer we add just a touch of real raspberries during the fermentation process. The result is a modest fruit flavor which enhances--- without dominating the rich"
Twelve,1,10.2,"Our 12th anniversary brew is a Rye Barleywine.  Checking in at 10.2% abv, Twelve is being released in July and through the end of the year.   Made from 50% Rye Malt and 50% Barley Malt, this strong ale is extremely viscous. The rye adds a tantalizing note of flavor on the palate with a hint of tartness you've come to expect from Rye.  Slightly warm when its young, the beer will age very well, perhap 5 years or more.  We're guessing that peak taste will be in the 1 to 2 year old range, with 3 and 4 not far behind.  Be sure to lay some down in your collection."
Samuel Adams OctoberFest,1,5.7,"The first thing you notice when pouring a glass of this seasonal beer is the color. Samuel AdamsÂ® Octoberfest has a rich, deep golden amber hue which itself is reflective of the season. Samuel AdamsÂ® Octoberfest is a malt lover's dream, masterfully blending together five roasts of barley to create a delicious harmony of sweet flavors including caramel and toffee. The beer is kept from being overly sweet by the elegant bitterness imparted by the German Noble hops. Samuel AdamsÂ® Octoberfest provides a wonderful transition from the lighter beers of summer to the winter's heartier brews."
Samuel Adams Scotch Ale,1,5.4,"This is a brew for adventurous beer drinkers. It is brewed with four malts: two row pale Harrington, Munich malt, chocolate malt, and a rare peat smoked malt commonly used by distillers of Scotch malt whiskey. This unique malt gives Samuel Adams® Scotch Ale its distinct, subtle smoky character and deep amber hue. Samuel Adams® Scotch Ale is brewed using traditional English hops, Goldings and Fuggles. This is a big brew dominated by malt flavors and aromas, rich and full bodied, slightly sweet. Its layered malt complexity lingers to a smooth and silky finish."
Garde Dog,1,5.8,"Proving the French may actually know something we don't... Garde Dog is a traditional French Biere de Garde or \beer for keeping\"". This classic farmhouse ale was brewed in March for drinking during the spring and summer months. With it's toasted aroma and spicy"

HIPA,1,6.8,
120 Minute IPA,1,18,"Too extreme to be called beer? Brewed to a colossal 45-degree plato, boiled for a full 2 hours while being continuously hopped with high-alpha American hops, then dry-hopped daily in the fermenter for a month & aged for nother month on whole-leaf hops!!! Our 120 Minute I.P.A. is by far the biggest I.P.A. ever brewed! At 20% abv and 120 ibus you can see why we call this beer THE HOLY GRAIL for hopheads!

-changed to be 18% for aging purposes according to Dogfish Head brewery."
90 Minute IPA,1,9,"Esquire Magazine calls our 90 Minute .IPA., \perhaps the best I.P.A. in America.\"" An Imperial I.P.A. brewed to be savored from a snifter. A big beer with a great malt backbone that stands up to the extreme hopping rate. This beer is an excellent candidate for use with Randall The Enamel Animal!"""

Imperial Espresso Porter,1,8,"This robust dark brew has been created using rich Colombian dark roast coffee to celebrate our 10th anniversary in royal fashion. The enticing regal aromas of toffee and licorice lead to the coronation of taste; a palate of malty richness exhibiting chocolate and coffee notes, balanced by the noble and novel Mt. Rainer hop, all topped with a rich creamy crown. This very special offering will warm your soul and lift your spirits. Oh yeah, it also packs a royal kick at 8% alcohol."
Duchesse de Bourgogne,1,6.2,"DUCHESSE DE BOURGOGNE
from Brouwerij Verhaeghe is the traditional Flemish red ale. This refreshing ale is matured in oak casks; smooth with a rich texture and interplay of passion fruit, and chocolate, and a long, dry and acidic finish. After the first and secondary fermentation, the beer goes for maturation into the oak barrels for 18 months. The final product is a blend of younger 8 months old beer with 18 months old beer. The average age of the Duchesse de Bourgogne before being bottled is 12 months."
Farmhouse Summer Ale,1,0,"A tribute to the highly drinkable \every day\"" beers from French-speaking Belgium. Contains Belgian two-row pale malt and 7% wheat. This beer is lightly filtered with an earthy"
HopFish IPA,1,6.2,"At the request of you hopheads, we produced this I.P.A. with a deep golden color, plenty of hop bitterness balanced by malt sweetness. Because of the extensive dry hopping, there's a floral and citrus hop finish. It's then lightly filtered to maintain the appropriate body and flavor. The beer features a combination of American, English and German malts to balance the large amount of hops. The HopFish also uses three hop varieties at five different times and has been dry-hopped for two weeks with 22lbs of Nugget whole leaf hops."
Belgian Abbey Dubbel,1,7,"This Belgian-style Abbey Dubbel is an exceptionally complex beer with many interwoven flavors. This classic-style Abbey beer features an immense head with a fruity nose and a generous body. Malty in the middle, the beer features a clean, almondy dry finish and a slight alcohol warmth. More like a wine than a beerâ€”it has a lot of the qualities of a fine Burgundy.

Beer writer Michael Jackson has praised the Flying Fish Dubbel as \a wonderful example of the style.\"""""
ESB Ale,1,5.5,"This ESB is a classic British extra special bitter made fresh with an American slant. A beautiful copper color with an amber head, this classic style features five different malts, including imported English malts, and three hop varieties. The rich malty start features caramel notes that develop into a smooth, pleasurable hop finish."
Extra Pale Ale,1,4.8,"An original American pale ale, our XPA highlights the subtle, sophisticated flavors and aromas of our Midwestern two-row malt and imported aromatic and Munich malts. Washington-grown Mt. Hood and Magnum hops create an extremely balanced beer with a beautiful straw color."
OktoberFish,1,5.5,"First released in 2002, and sold out in two weeks. A tribute to the classic Fest styles of Germany the O'Fish uses European malts hops and yeast. A beautiful reddish color, a savory malt profile and nice hop flavor, make this Fest beer quite drinkable. OktoberFish is great with food and especially great with Lederhosen."
Grand Cru Winter Reserve,1,7.2,"This Belgian-style strong golden ale showcases a variety of the ingredients and brewing methods that help differentiate Flying Fish beers. The Grand Cru is fermented at a higher temperature than our other beers adding an undercurrent of fruitiness (although there is no fruit in the beer). Very lightly filtered, the Grand Cru exhibits complex mouthfeel, strong malt flavors, a spicy hop presence and a soothing alcohol warmth, followed by a clean, dry finish. It is excellent with food as well as served by itself."
Scotch Ale,1,6,"Exceptionally smooth and thoroughly robust, Weyerbacher Scotch Ale has a deep delicious flavor that will warm you down to your wee little bones. Malty and roasty on the palate, and with distinctive caramel notes, this beer will satisfy the desires of any malty beer aficionado. 

Weyerbacher Scotch Ale is our interpretation of a beer style originating from Scotland, where the chilly damp weather calls for a hearty beer. Lacking the preservative powers of hops, scotch ales were brewed with high alcohol content to prevent spoilage. And at 8.7% ABV (alcohol by volume) Weyerbacher Scotch Ale definitely contains a warming belt.

We brew Weyerbacher Scotch Ale mostly in the cooler months of the year. Check out the Upcoming Events and Beers page for the next time it will be at a beer store near you."

A festive-occasion beer, brown ale is one of the oldest English brewing styles, mentioned in literature in the 16th century. Beers brewed at the old brewery have a round, nutty flavor because of the Yorkshire square system of fermentation."

This beer is also available in some markets in tradtional cask form, as Adnams Bitter. At only 3.7% alcohol, Adnams Bitter is the classic English 'ordinary,' though we think you'll agree that there's full of flavor.

Despite its rich heritage and enduring fame, Adnams is not a company willing to rest on its laurels.

Samuel Adams White Ale,1,0,"Spicy yet smooth. Brewed with 10 exotic spices.
This beer's roots are in Belgium, and the classic Wit biers produced by Belgium's brewers. The style gets its name from the white, milky appearance of this unfiltered wheat ale. The brewers of Samuel AdamsÂ® beer, taking inspiration from the Belgians, have created a classic of their own. On the malt side, we use malted two row Pale barley, malted wheat, and Munich malt to give this beer a crisp, malty, cereal finish and smooth mouth feel. The hops used are Noble Tettnang Tettnanger hops. At the end of the kettle boil, we add a proprietary spice blend to give Samuel AdamsÂ® White Ale a unique and complex flavor, without being overpowering or cloying. The spice blend includes orange and lemon peel, dried plum, grains of paradise, coriander, anise, hibiscus, rose hips, tamarind, and vanilla. It is this special blend of spices that gives Samuel AdamsÂ® White Ale its unique character, complexity and refreshing drinkability.

Sam Adams Light,1,0,"Great tasting yet drinkable, with a clean smooth finish.  Sam Adams Light® is not just a lighter version of our Samuel Adams Boston Lager® but rather the culmination of over two years of tireless research and brewing trials to create a flavorful Light beer.

Samuel Adams Old Fezziwig Ale,1,5.9,"Spicy and Bold, a big Christmas cookie of a beer.
Samuel Adams® Old Fezziwig® Ale is the Christmas cookie of beer. Bursting with spices of the season and a remarkably full body, it helps those long winter nights pass much quicker. The full body hits the palate first with a depth of malt character ranging from sweeter toffee and caramel notes to the more dark, roasty chocolate notes. Then come the spices in full force. Cinnamon, ginger and orange peel dance on the tongue bringing with them the celebratory spirit that goes hand in hand with the season."
Samuel Adams Holiday Porter,1,5.8,"A Traditional, British style. Robust and full bodied.  Introduced as a member of the Winter Classics Mix Pack in 2004, Samuel Adams® Holiday Porter with its rich malt complexity has become a favorite among our winter seasonal brews.

Add generous portions of imported hops to the mix and one has a brew that is both robust and high in drinkability."

Hefeweizen,1,5,"This is a Bavarian ale which uses 51% wheat malt in the recipe. Very low bitterness. It is unfiltered so the characteristic cloudiness is achieved.

While some of this aroma carries over to the flavor"

Hop Knot IPA get its peculiar name from the weaving of four different hops added at four separate times during the brewing process. Including our cavernous hop-back, which gets so stuffed with whole leaf hops that we feel genuine guilt for its excess. Hop Knot is an ale that is to be enjoyed with friends, spicy food or any time you need a good hop fix without the harsh bitterness.

Alcohol content approximately 6.9% by volume (ALWAYS ON TAP!!)"
Oatmeal Stout,1,5,"Our Oatmeal Stout is definitely a local favorite but it gets its origins from one of London's oldest breweries. The Oatmeal Stout differs from the popular Irish stout in its more subtle roastiness and subdued dryness. The addition of flaked oats rounds out these sometimes harsh characteristics producing a velvet smooth ale. This black stout has a flavor profile unique to all of North America. Subtlety is not a strong point as it is a stout after all, rich and eminently drinkable. 

Alcohol content of approximately 5.0% by volume (ALWAYS ON TAP!!)"
Arizona Peach,1,4,"The dominating character of this beer is of course peach flavor and aroma. It is a little more subtle than most fruit beers which makes it more approachable. Light in body and color.

Abbey Normal Ale,1,0,A Belgian Double Abbey.
American-Style Brown Ale,1,5,Leroy's BIG Brother. Sweet floral hop aroma balances out the big malty roasted body with the slightest bitter spiced-chocolate finish.

Alt Ball and Chain,1,5.2,"This beer was brewed in honor of our brewer Melissa's wedding to fellow brewer Derek Osbourne of B.J.'s in Chandler. The Alt Ball and Chain is a German Altbier.

Our Alt has been lagering in our cellar for two weeks and contains 5.2% abv."
Barrel-Aged Blind Date Ale,1,7.5,"This is the old tried and true Blind Date Ale of old. It is based on an English Olde Ale but has an addition of 300 pounds of Arizona grown Medjool dates. The dates contribute a complexity and sweetness that the malt alone cannot. This Blind Date has been aged for three months in Jim Beam oak bourbon barrels. The oak and bourbon lend flavors of vanilla, wood, and of course, bourbon. These flavors layered with the dates created a big, multi-leveled ale. The alcohol content is about 7.5% alc/vol. You'll have to get to Four Peaks quick since we only have a few kegs of this unique beer."
Belgian Wit,1,0,"Belgian Wits originated in Belgium, in the area of Brabant just east of Brussels. This are was a part of the Netherlands in the early 1800's and was the wheat growing region. In this era, the Dutch basically controlled the spice trade, thus, coriander as well as Curacao orange peel made its way into the beer. Spices were used well before the widespread use of hops in beer. At one point there were more than thirty breweries producing a Wit, but overtime the style died off and in 1954 the last of the breweries ceased operations. One of the most famous brands of Belgian Wits is Hoegaarden (pronounced \Who Garden\"") produced by Pierre Celis back in 1966. This revived the style and by the 1980's it was popular again!

Belgian Wits are similar to a Hefeweizen with respect to the cloudiness of the beer and some phenolic (clove) and tart flavors. Wits should have white"
Blind Date Ale,1,7,One of a kind ale. Brewed with 600 pounds of Arizona grown Medjool Dates added to the kettle. 1998 Gold Medal GABF. Alcohol content varies as every brew is slightly different. Usually very strong with sherry or port-like flavors. Brewed quarterly. Alcohol content approximately 7-9% by volume.
Black Betty Schwartzbier,1,5,"This almost black lager originates from Germany and is most closely associated with Porter. The difference being the long maturation period (or lagering time) required to produce a true Schwartzbier. The flavor is reminiscent of treacle, coffee and toasted malt. It is not and should not be perceived as burnt or ashy like some stouts. Black Betty has 5% alc/vol and a smooth character that marks most lager beers.

The name, of course, comes from the Huddy Ledbetter song from the 1940â€™s which was made popular by the band Ram Jam and later by the Black Crows and U2, among others."
Caulfield's Rye,1,4.9,"Our rye beer is made with 20% flaked rye and rye malt. The addition of rye creates a dry, spicy flavor with a crisp, grainy aroma. We went with a lighter color and lower bitterness to compliment these flavors. It has an alcohol content of around 4.9%."

Raspberry Wheat,1,4.5,"A golden wheat beer brewed with the finest North American malted barley and wheat.  It's then lightly hopped with the choicest European varieties.  The smooth, crisp golden wheat beer is then finished with a hint of rasberry.  Enjoy this beer any time of the year."
Chimay PremiÃ¨re (Chimay Red),1,7,"First sold in 75 cl (25.4 fl.oz.) bottles, it is noted for its coppery colour which makes it particularly attractive.

Topped with a creamy head, it gives off a light, fruity apricot aroma produced by the fermentation. The taste perceived in the mouth is a balance confirming the fruity nuances noticed in the fragrance. 

Its taste, which imparts a silky sensation to the tongue, is made refreshing by a light touch of bitterness. To the palate, the taster perceives a pleasant astringency which complements the flavour qualities of this beer very harmoniously.

This top fermented Trappist beer, refermented in the bottle, is not pasteurised."
Chimay Triple (Chimay White),1,8,"Named Cinq Cents in 75 cl (25.4 fl.oz.) bottles, this beer with its typical golden colour, its slightly hazy appearance and its fine head is especially characterised by its aroma which results from an agreeable combination of fresh hops and yeast. 

The beer's flavour, as sensed in the mouth, comes from the smell of hops: above all it is the fruity notes of muscat and raisins that give this beer a particularly attractive aroma. 

The aroma complements the touch of bitterness. There is no acidity, but an after-bitterness which melts in the mouth.

This top fermented Trappist beer, refermented in the bottle, is not pasteurised."
Samuel Adams Cream Stout,1,0,"The Cappucino of beers. Roasty, smooth and sweet.
Samuel Adams® Cream Stout is a true cream stout, balancing body and sweetness with the natural spiciness of grain and hand selected English hops.

Its dark mahogany color make it almost as easy on the eyes as it is on the palate."
Samuel Adams Hefeweizen,1,0,"Unfiltered wheat ale, fruity, bright, with a crisp flavor of wheat.  Samuel Adams® Hefeweizen beer is a traditional spin on a classic American craft brewing style. The brewers of Samuel Adams® used both malted and unmalted wheat, and two row Pale barley for a clean malty, cereal note. This bright, fruity wheat ale is unfiltered, retaining a natural haze from malt proteins, crisp, bright flavors of wheat, and fresh, fruity ester complexity from our proprietary ale yeast.

This brew is the perfect complement to glazed ham, spicy chili, and roasted vegetables like beets and carrots, which bring out the herbal notes found in the hops and the sweetness of the honey. Samuel Adams® Honey Porter also pairs well with rich desserts such as baklava and molasses cookies."
Samuel Adams Irish Red,1,0,"Malty and slightly sweet, balanced by earthy notes from the hops.  The gentle rain and fertile soil of Ireland helped inspire this style of ale, known for being remarkably balanced. Pale and Caramel malts give the beer its rich, deep red color and distinctive caramel flavor.

Samuel Adams® Irish Red finishes smooth and leaves you wanting to take another sip."

Curacao (bitter) orange peel and coriander create a beautiful yet bolder tripel by infusing color, citrus and spice. Belgian yeast adds playful character. Bottle conditioning assures a perfectly heady experience.

Brewed as a Belgian tripel but with American boldness, Panty Peeler is delicious yet spirited. Originally named Extreme Polar White Bier, it got nicknamed \Panty Peeler\"" along the way. Then we translated it to French for a while: E'pluche-culotte. Now we're back to calling it Panty Peeler and we've kicked up the coriander and orange peel to represent its original design.

It has been identified as one of the few surviving examples of Vienna style lager - a style that was largely replaced in European breweries with Oktoberfest, a slightly lighter lager, in the early twentieth century. 
Negra Modelo pours with an off-white, medium head. The body is clear with a rich amber/copper color. The aroma is sweet with hints of apple. The impression at the first sip is sweet. This gives way only a bit to some hops bitterness which gives some balance but leaves the beer firmly in the sweet category. It has no real lager snap at the end, just lingering hops. This actually makes the second sip more balanced than the first.

There is some complexity and depth here but the flavors are very delicate. They are obliterated by the aggressive flavors of the Mexican food that Modelo is often served with making it a sweet balance to the savory and sometimes hot cuisine."
Birra Moretti La Rossa,1,7.2,"Birra Moretti La Rossa is a double boch beer produced using high quality 100% malted barley, giving it a rich sweet taste and an intense fragrance of roasted malt. The amber color that characterizes the beer, comes from the kind of malt used in the recipe (malt is dried, roasted barley). Another key ingredient is hops, the variety used is particularly aromatic, giving a characteristic bitter aftertaste and a delicate fragrance to the beer. The Master Brewers advise a service temperature between 10Â° and 12Â° C."

Lone Star,1,4.65,"The National Beer of Texas
\Lone Star beer uses the finest hops from the Pacific Northwest with hearty grains from the Central and Northern Plains. The GABF recognized Lone Star as a high quality American Cream Lager by awarding it with a silver medal. Malted barley and corn extract combine to provide Lone Star with nature's finest ingredients for brewing. Lone Star's ingredients give this beer its full natural flavor. The choicest hops lend complexity and aroma to this beer"
Thomas Hooker Irish Red Ale,1,5.3,"Thomas Hooker's traditional Irish-Style Red Ale gets its warm, ruby color from an interesting blend of pale, caramel and roasted malts which promote a sweetness that's balanced with crisp, authentic, English-style hops. A very unique and drinkable red ale that's also favored by amber lovers.
Hooker Irish Red is drinks well year-round, not just on St. Paddy's day."
Bud Extra,1,6.6,"Originally known as \B to the E\"""""
Bud Dry,1,5,"Introduced in 1989 Bud Dry is the first dry-brewed beer produced by an American brewer. It is brewed with select hops, grains and barley malt, which results in a lighter body and less-sweet taste. As with all Anheuser-Busch beers, it is cold-filtered for a smooth draft taste, but then goes through a second cold-filtered finishing process to provide its unique taste."

Rockslide IPA is brewed in the 'West Coast' style with aggressive amounts of American hops such as Amarillo, Centennial and Summit hops.

Hoegaarden,1,4.9,"Hoegaarden is the authentic Belgian wheat or white beer. It has a unique and extremely complex brewing process whereby the brand is first top fermented and then is refermented within the bottle - ending up in a unique cloudy-white appearance. The brand's unique appearance is mirrored by its one-of-a-kind taste - sweet and sour beer with a little bitterness, slightly spicy, with a strong touch of coriander and a hint of orange, perfect for warm summer days, instead of other refreshing beverages. Refreshing, a little quirky, and decidedly different - naturally."

Gumballhead,1,4.8,"Three Floyds official summer beer highly dry hopped American wheat beer. Quite hoppy. Gumballhead is brewed from red wheat and amarillo hops. It has a medium haze, due to bottle conditioning; once the beer is bottled, extra yeast is added for a secondary fermentation. The hops give off a pronounced citrus note on the nose. Notes of bread - from the yeast - and a good malt undertone. Medium carbonation."
Honker's Ale,1,0,"Honkerâ€™s Ale combines a spicy hop aroma with a rich malt middle to create a perfectly balanced ale that is immensely drinkable. A smooth, drinkable English Bitter for those looking for more from their beer."

Anchor Summer Beer,1,4.6,"Anchor Summer is the first American wheat beer in modern times. Our first brew of this light and refreshing beer was in the summer of 1984.

Anchor Summer is an all-malt beer, and over 50% of its malt comes from malted wheat. It is fermented with a Triticum aestivum, AKA wheat traditional top-fermenting \ale\"" yeast because we prefer the clean flavors developed by this yeast. We believe that this style best celebrates the refreshingly light flavor of malted wheat. You may notice that the head on this beer is unusually abundant"

Lions Gate Lager,1,0,"While ales are fermented for relatively short periods of time at room temperature, lagers employ a special variety of yeast and much cooler fermentation temperatures to achieve their truly clean, dry flavour profile. Our Lion's Gate Lager has a light body, a very crisp palate and a soft, hop finish, which is imparted by the exquisitely gentle Czech Saaz hop variety. The Lions would approve."
Cascadia Cream Ale,1,0,"Every year in Vancouver there are a few days when the air is cool & crisp, the sun shines brightly, and the leaves show their vibrant colours -- then it starts to rain incessantly. Anyway, our Cascadia Cream Ale is dedicated to the spirit of mountains, oceans, golden days and gentle mist. Caramel and honey malts lend this ale a mellow, grainy maltiness which is balanced by the subtle presence of English finishing hops. Cheers, our Cascadia Cream Ale will be sure to brighten up even the wettest West Coast day."
Signature Pale Ale,1,0,"The term \Pale Ale\"" dates back to the 1800s when all beer was dark brown in colour. New malting techniques led to the development of pale malt"
Nirvana Nut Brown Ale,1,0,"Our regulars have many reasons for frequenting our premises. Some come for the comfy chairs, a game of pool, or to exude some seriously suaveness at the oyster bar on a Friday evening. For the truly devoted, however, who come in search of truth, it's the Nut Brown they're after. Often they arrive with a glazed look in their eyes, having endured days of office drudgery or the unknowable hardships of securing a parking spot. Set your cares aside, for all can find solace in this ale's yin-yang of nutty maltiness and delicate, dryish hoppiness. For our Nut Brown, an ale deep auburn in colour, we use a blend of Munich, caramel and chocolate malts to create a rich malty palate with a lingering dry chocolatiness."
Empress India Pale Ale,1,0,"During the heyday of the British Empire, India Pale Ale was born as a strong pale ale brewed especially to endure the rigors of the long journey to the colonies. In order to guard against spoilage, I.P.A. was brewed with a high alcohol content and with liberal amounts of hops, which act as a natural preservative. This ale's golden amber colour only hints at its full-bodied flavour. Its sumptuous maltiness is tempered by a goodly amount of bitterness and a mouth-filling hop flavour. In order to finish our I.P.A. with a truly fresh hop bouquet, we dry hop this ale in the serving tank with both East Kent Goldings and Mount Hood hops."
Heroica Oatmeal Stout,1,0,"There are some things in life that require a certain sense of bravado: these might include ordering a quadruple espresso, deciding to sleep without a nightlight, or choosing to live in a region of the continent that is gradually sinking into the Pacific Ocean. If you're no longer scared of the dark, then there's no reason to be afraid of our stout. A generous portion of rolled oats and lots of black roasted barley give this beer a warm, roasted nose, and a distinct dryness that succumbs to waves of lingering satisfaction."
Pilsner,1,0,"Our Pilsner is a true beer drinker's beer inspired by the first golden lagers brewed in the Czech town of Pilsn. This full-bodied lager is hopped with copious amounts of Sterling hops, lending it a refreshing, citrusy finish."
Skinny Tire Hefeweizen,1,0,"Our Hefeweizen is a faithful version of the traditional Bavarian wheat beer. Hefe is the German word for 'yeast' and weizen means 'wheat'. This beer is made with 40% wheat malt and is brewed with a special yeast that tends to stay in suspension, giving the beer its cloudy appearance. Bavarians are so convinced of the healthful qualities of this yeasty brew that doctors there are known to prescribe two Hefeweizens a day to feeble patients. The yeast used for this brew also imparts its unique spicy, clovey flavour. Some people even detect a light banana flavour. All of these wacky flavours are the natural 'signature' left by this specific yeast strain during its fermentation of the beer and no additional spices are added."
Coal Porter,1,0,"As you look out over Vancouver's Coal Harbour, relax with this creamy delight. Don't let the colour fool you - this porter is rich but not overpowering with a head that lingers all the way down the glass. Just about anything goes with our Coal Porter, and you don't have to belong to \High Society\"" to enjoy a glass with oysters."""
The Great Pumpkin Ale,1,0,"A spiced ale that tastes just like pumpkin pie in a glass.

The Pumpkin Ale is a malty, copper coloured brew that's spiced with cinnamon, cloves, nutmeg and ginger. We add 100 lbs of pumpkin directly to the mash and the resulting beer tastes just like pumpkin pie in a glass."
Sour Cherry Ale,1,0,"An intriguing fruit beer brewed with fresh sour cherries.

Our Sour Cherry Ale is inspired by the centuries old Belgian tradition of brewing beer with cherries. This high gravity brew undergoes a slow second fermentation with tons of fresh, whole Montmorency cherries from a local orchard in the Fraser Valley. The result is a most intriguing beer with an elegant cherry perfume, a tart, fruity flavour, and a subtle almondy finish."
Blitzen Christmas Ale,1,8.5,"A strong, fruity, belgian-style trippel 8.5% alc./vol.

Our aptly named Christmas Ale is based on the strong beers traditionally brewed by Belgium's trappist monasteries. Trippel is typically at least 8% alc./vol. and has a light golden colour. Because of its high strength this beer has an intensely fruity palate. Up front it has a honeyish sweetness but the finish is dry and champagne-like. Most weary Christmas shoppers would be well advised to benefit from the warmth and 'ho-ho-ho factor' that only a beer of the Biltzen's calibre can provide."
HURRICANE I.P.A.,1,0,"â€œA complex, flavourful and fascinating ale lies just on the edge of being totally out of control.â€ â€”Stephan Beaumont, Celebrator Beer News

India Pale Ale dates back to the 1700â€™s when Britain needed a hearty beer to ship to her troops in India. Because the ships had to cross the equator twice to get there, spoilage was a major problem until some clever brewer realized that both alcohol and hops are natural preservatives. James brews Hurricane I.P.A. in this tradition, and packs it with enough hops and alcohol to survive crossing the orbit of Mercury twice. The grist is 100% Gambrinus premium 2-row barley malt, copiously hopped with fresh Centennial and Willamette. The result is a rich, golden, intense beer with bitterness in perfect balance with residual sweetness."
Black Plague Stout,1,0,Derives its name from the historical fact that at one time in Europe beer was about the only safe liquid to drink. Black Plague is Irish style dry stout brewed only in fall and winter and only in small batches to ensure the freshness so paramount to such an intensely roasted beer.
Highland Scottish Ale,1,0,"While hugely popular in Scotland, this style of beer escapes most North Americans. Designed and brewed by the Scottish punk rocker David â€œMaltyâ€ Macanulty, this creamy, nutty, malty, dark ale is true to its origins. David drives James crazy over this beer, insisting on rigid fermentation temperatures, traditional mild hops for bittering, and even some weird caramelizing ritual as the kettle is being filled. The beer continues to undergo subtle evolutionary changes because the stubborn Scottish bastard will never be satisfied."
Precipitation Pilsner,1,0,"A true North German Style Pilsner. Light in body and packed full of Czech Saaz hops. The distinctive Pilsner aroma and dry, refreshing taste make a great accompaniment to a hot Vanouver day."
Fruit Lambics,1,0,"These authentic Belgian-style ales are intensely sour, dry and complex. All three of the lambics - Raspberry, Blackberry and Black Cherry - are aged in oak casks for more than one year. 15 kg, give or take, of whole unpasteurized fruit is added to each 200 litre oak barrel of fermented beer. The naturally occurring wild yeasts cause a second, slow fermentation, breaking down the fruit sugars to total dryness."

Blanche de Chambly is only partially filtered,
retaining its natural cloud of yeast that is
characteristic of the original white ales

Redolent of ripe Granny Smith apples, this
unique white ale pleases the palate with a
delicate balance of fruit and spice notes and
just a hint of sweetness.
 
Ã‰phÃ©mÃ¨re apple satisfies with each sip and
refreshes in all seasons, especially when
paired with an artisan cheddar cheese, pork
tenderloin served with apple chutney or Vidalia
onion soup.

We developed the Ã‰phÃ©mÃ¨re (Ephemeral)
series to feature a seasonal fruit in a
refreshing, lightly spiced white ale.
 
The label depicts a fairy, an ephemeral spirit
associated with fruits picked at the peak of
ripeness during each harvest season. 
Ã‰phÃ©mÃ¨re apple flavor is brewed with apple
must, which consists of the freshly-pressed
juice from apples.

Enjoy this beer 'alfresco' while dining in the
afternoon sun, relaxing at a family gathering or
at a picnic in the back yard.

Seigneuriale,1,7.5,"The copper-colored body and generous foam
head of this amber ale tantalize the eyes but
it's the complex flavor of Seigneuriale that
delivers a pleasant surprise. It is slightly
sweet, malty and spicy, but a distinctive hop
character and notes of apricot brandy give
Seigneuriale a truly unique character. 

We recommending pairing it with carved ham,
apricot-glazed duck or squab, Thai shrimp
curry or a holiday fruit cake."
Chambly Noire,1,6.2,"The opaque blackness and beige-colored
foam mousse of Chambly Noire belie its light,
refreshing body and clean, long finish,
featuring hints of roasted coffee beans, toast
and toffee. 

We recommend pairing it with grilled salmon,
steak or tuna au poivre, smoked meats,
coffee-crusted rack of lamb, or chocolate
espresso flan."
Dos Perros,1,3.5,"Many Mexican beer styles today are descendants of old Austrian styles, from when Austria ruled Mexico in the late 19th century. Our Dos Perros is made with German Munich malt, English Pale malt, and Chocolate malt, and hopped with Perle and Saaz hops. To lighten the body, as many Mexican brewers do, we add a small portion of flaked maize. The result is a wonderfully bready malt aroma, balanced with some maize sweetness and a noble hop finish.

Food Pairings: The toasty malt flavors go great with barbeque, grilled salmon, carmelized onions, and most hot and spicy foods. Try it with Mexican or Thai dishes.

Made with English Pale, Munich, Vienna, and Crystal malts, and generously hopped with Amarillo, Perle, and Cascade hops. Fermented with our English ale yeast.

Food Pairings: The bracing bitterness of this beer can hold its own with spicy foods, while helping to cleanse the palate after rich, creamy dishes. The citrus hop flavors go exceptionally well with any dishes using cilantro, such as Mexican salsas.

Exceptionally smooth and satisfying. Made with English Pale malt, roasted barley, black patent malt, and flaked barley. Hopped with East Kent Goldings and Target hops, and fermented with our English ale yeast.

Food Pairings: The combination of Onward Stout and oysters is a match made in heaven. It also goes well with other shellfish, grilled steaks, and believe it or not, rich chocolate desserts. Carbonade Flamande, seared beef cubes simmered in Stout for several hours, is a classic Belgian dish.

Hop Henge Imperial IPA,1,8.75,"HOP HENGE IMPERIAL IPA â€“ The Ultimate in Hop Innovation 

Hop Henge Imperial IPA returns to the Bond Street Series line-up this April in extreme fashion. Staying true to the experimental nature of the series and the â€œnever settleâ€ philosophy of Deschutes, our brewers went back to the drawing board to create an amplified version of last yearâ€™s monument to hops.

Head Brewer Brett Porter says, â€œThis is a truly exciting and groundbreaking beer. We reformulated everything about the hop recipe to give Hop Henge an extraordinary aroma and flavor similar to a fresh hop beer.â€ In addition to the Cascade and Centennial hops, Deschutes Brewery is experimenting with a hop variety so new that it has yet to be named.

The team here at Bend Public House recommends Hop Henge as the perfect accompaniment for a variety of spicy foods, so be sure to have a bottle handy next time you make a batch of hot wings and go for the five alarm award. The high-octane hoppiness is a wildly refreshing antidote to a wide array of hot foods.

Limited Availability April through June.

Donâ€™t miss this amazing hop experiment that is sure to leave your taste buds begging for more.

-http://www.deschutesbrewery.com/Brews/Bond+Street+Series/default.aspx

Available April through June.

Hop Henge I.P.A. was first brewed in 2006 as an agressive West Coast style I.P.A. In 2007, Hop Henge is going Imperial!  Several pounds of  Centennial, Cascade and Northern Brewer hops are in each barrel with a heavy dry-hop presence to top it off.  A blend of crystal, pale and caraston malts creates an overall biscuity characteristic that is dense and muscular, building the alcohol base to support the monstrous hop profile.

Like the rest of the Bond Street Series, Hop Henge highlights the creativity and curiosity of our brewers.  Bolder than its English ancestors, with huge hops and a bitter finish, this IPA is no wallflower.

Alcohol By Volume: 8.1%
	

IBU 95

When one of our brewers suggested we name our new IPA Hop Henge, he also came up with the idea of actually recreating Stonehenge, only with hop bales.  We were up for the challenge and even though the weather did not want to cooperate, we pulled it off and threw a party afterwards.

5 out 5 stars 
Hop Henge started its life as an India Pale Ale, but this year it was bumped up to â€œImperial IPAâ€ status, with a hefty dose of additional hops.
â€œThis one is lovely,â€ said taster Tom Conti. â€œThey got it just right.â€
It pours out a deep amber, with an appealing rocky head, and rich hop aroma wafting from the glass. â€œThey sure dosed it with a lot of hops...[thereâ€™s] a lot of hop bitterness in the taste,â€ one taster observed.
In addition to the Imperial-level hopping, Hop Henge also boasts Imperial-level alcohol content, with 8.1% a.b.v.
This was the top-rated beer during its tasting session, and tasters had to dig deep for new superlatives to describe it. â€œThis is a beautiful beer,â€ concluded taster Gregg Glaser. â€œFull of flavor and hops and malt and hops again.â€
â€œNot for the timid,â€ said taster Robert Lachman.

Bube's Kiwi-Strawberry Wheat,1,0,The perfect thirst quenching summertime ale. The subtle flavor of kiwi and strawberry blend with traditional German wheat and hops. Great for a hot summer day.
Bube's Brown Ale,1,0,"Another one of our first recipes, which we have improved with experience. This ale is pleasantly malty with nutty and toffee like undertones. East Kent Golding hops were used to compliment this English style ale."
Bube's Hefeweizen,1,0,"This traditional German-style wheat beer is rich in banana and clove undertones, with a wonderful frothy head."
Bube's India Pale Ale (IPA),1,0,"Bube's rendition of this classic style is made with fine 2-row malted barley and West Coast hops. A wonderful malt finish with a delicate citrus aroma, reminiscent of its Old-World cousin."
Scratch #7 2008,1,7.9,"Red and white wheat combined with darker malts add body to this hazy, unfiltered ale.  Fermented with the same yeast as DreamWeaver Wheat replicating the pepper, clove and all-spice flavors found in our year-round beer."
Scratch #11 2008,1,4.9,"Next up, we present Scratch Beer #11-2008, a Bitter. Back in the day, we used to brew a little number called TrÃ¶egs ESB. Even though this beer was retired almost six years ago, we still get numerous TrÃ¶egs old-schoolers (Martha) begging for its return.

Well hang onto your boot straps because Scratch #11 is about as close as we can get to the original ESB without firing up the old brew kettle. The Scratch #11 recipe originates from Chrisâ€™ stint at Englandâ€™s University of Sunderland brewing program. After returning to Colorado the brothers drew on Chrisâ€™ experience and brewed pilot batches tweaking that recipe. The ESB production recipe has direct bloodlines to these pilot batches.

The Thames Valley ale yeast and the roasted barley create a biscuit flavor with nutty undertones. Combining these flavors with the earthiness of East Kent Golding hops creates one hell of a fine session beer. Take in the deep mahogany beauty of this beer and breathe in the full hoppy nose. Itâ€™s not the ESB, but itâ€™s damn special."
Scratch #10 2008,1,10.2,"he third time just might be the charmâ€”Scratch #10-2008 is our third triple in the Scratch Beer series.

This grand cru has been lovingly aged since late-February, yet still unleashes the slightest hint of alcohol heat.

Scratch #10-2008 also has a triple flavor inspiration combining the caramel/toffee notes of dememera sugar and molasses, with citrus and licorice flavors created by the orange peel and star anise; lastly we create a peppery/spicy finish with the same trappist yeast has been used in each Scratch Beer Triple."
Scratch #8 2008,1,10.1,"Revisiting Scratch #3, we take the same Tripel recipe, add beet and cane sugars to the kettle, and run the wort through our hopback brimming with juniper berries, coriander and yarrow flowers.

Inspired by the herbaceous nose of gin, the berries and flowers give a slight pine/citrus aroma with floral undertones. Scratch #8 has a dry, yeasty finish and noticeable alcohol warming when consumed."
Scratch #6 2007,1,5.1,"Old world brewing techniques combine with Noble hops for Scratch #6-2007.
This Export Lager features a single stage decoctionâ€”a first for TrÃ¶egs Brewery. After combining barley and water we transfer a portion of the mash to the brew kettle for a quick boil. The heated mash is then returned to the mash kettle and the brewing process continues. This process deepens the malt character and adds a subtle toffee backbone to this delicious lager.

Weâ€™ve added Magnum hops for bittering and Czech Saaz hops for aroma to create a classic European Noble hop flavor. 

Scratch #6-2007 is unfiltered, so there will be a slight haze to the beer."

Theobroma,1,9,"This beer is based on chemical analysis of pottery fragments found in Honduras which revealed the earliest known alcoholic chocolate drink used by early civilizations to toast special occasions.  The discovery of this beverage pushed back the earliest use of cocoa for human consumption more than 500 years to 1200 BC.  As per the analysis, Dogfish Headâ€™s Theobroma (translated into 'food of the gods') is brewed with Aztec cocoa powder and cocoa nibs, honey, chilies, and annatto (fragrant tree seeds)."

Pipe Organ Pale Ale,1,4.9,"When the British introduced draught pale ale to America, the Pipe Organ Pale Ale is what they had intended. It is truly British in character. Brewed with pale ale malt and a touch of caramel malt, it has a light copper color and subtle body. The maltiness is carefully balanced with only the best English hops - East Kent Goldings. Although this beer has a fair amount of hops, the caramel maltiness perfectly balances its profile."
Pious Monk Dunkel,1,5.2,"Gold Medal Winner of the Great American Beer Festival. Our beer is fairly dark in color, but donâ€™t be afraid. It is a perfect example that dark beers are not always strong beers. The body is surprisingly mellow, and the alcohol content is a bit lower than most people might think. It has a wonderfully clean and roasty aroma. Hop bitterness levels are kept in line, but is has a noticeable hop flavor."
Millennium Trippel,1,9,A Belgian Trippel is a very special type of beer. A Belgian Trippel could be called the beer version of a Champagne. It is very light in color and highly carbonated giving an appearance similar to Champagne. The flavor is somewhat sweet and malty as well as strong.
Celestial Gold,1,4.1,"This beer is golden in color with a light bubbly effervescence. The light body makes this lager beer appropriate for a business lunch or your evening sipping beer. The light malt flavor also accentuates the hop flavor. From the start, you will notice a fine hop aroma. As you sip the Celestial Gold, the subdued maltiness blends with a slight hop flavor. When this beer finishes, you will notice a pleasant hop bitterness. The bitterness will be mild and quite appropriate. Celestial Gold has been known to induce Celestial bliss."
Blast Furnace Oatmeal Stout,1,4.8,"Stouts have typically been a staple beverage in the UK.  There are many variations of stouts available. You can find dry stouts, milk stouts, Imperial stouts, American stouts, and even stouts made with oats.

At the Church Brew Works we have crafted delicious Toasted Oatmeal Stout.  The oats were blended with the best barley malt we have â€“ and we didnâ€™t stop there.  To give this beer a wonderful roasted flavor, we added unmalted, very darkly roasted barley.  The roasted barley is mixed with a generous portion of chocolate colored malt giving the Blast Furnace Stout a beautiful ruby hue.

We used our finest hops unsparingly to create a delicately balanced bitterness with a rich roastiness and fresh hop aroma. The Fuggles and East Kent Goldings hops were added with heavy hands at two different times.  This unbridled addition grants a full hop flavor to our heavenly drink.

A typical oatmeal stout is a bit lower in alcohol than most other stouts as does the Blast Furnace Stout.  Ours, though not typical, does have a welcome medium body.  As you drink this beer, notice the rich, creamy brown head.  Drink it slowly and savor the flavors.  We donâ€™t think you will be disappointed.  Beer is not just for breakfast anymore."
Church Brew Oktoberfest,1,5.2,Our Oktoberfest is a light amber colored beer.  It is malty in both flavor and aroma making it a delicate beer which is very drinkable. The hop bitterness is kept low to accentuate the maltiness.  Notice the crisp clean character and enjoy.  We brewed three batches of this beer so that we can bottle some of it in order to enhance our bottle beer selection.
Mad Brewer Maibock,1,7,"A bock beer is required by German law to start at 17Â°Plato.   For those who are interested, Â°Plato is a measurement of the sugar content before fermentation.  It is a very malty lager beer with medium hop bitterness.  A maibock is a light to amber colored bock beer.  A Maibock is very similar to a Helles/pale bock.  Maibocks were originally brewed for the coming of spring, hence the name Mai (German for May).  The Mad Brewer Maibock is medium amber in color.  Though similar in color to our Pipe Organ Pale Ale, it is very different in character.  Donâ€™t let it get you though, itâ€™s a very strong beer at about 7% alcohol. It has a very clean and malty nose.  The hop bitterness is evident, but not dominant.  The Mad Brewer Maibock will finish quite full and have a delicate sweetness."
Heavenly Hefeweizen,1,4.5,"Iâ€™m sure everyone here knows, Pittsburgh has some humid summers.  What can you do to escape the heat and enjoy yourself?  Well Iâ€™ve got the answer.  How about a light thirst quenching Hefe Weizen (pronounced hefa Vite zen) in the cool environment of our Hop Garden patio.  I can hear you wondering, what is a hefe weizen?  Allay your fears my friends because Iâ€™m going to tell you.  A hefe weizen is a special style of beer made with malted wheat and malted barley.  Hefe weizens are from Germany.  This beer is top fermented (an ale) with a very special yeast.  The Hop levels are kept deliberately low in order to bring out the character of the yeast.  If you notice the nose of the beer, it has a clove-like or fruity aroma.  The grain bill includes 50% wheat malt and 50% barley malt.  It is served very carbonated and a touch cloudy.  It is cloudy because it is served unfiltered.  The remaining yeast contributes flavor, adds B vitamins, and improves the beer as it ages."
Scratch #12 2008,1,6.5,"In our never-ending pursuit of answering the burning question of whatâ€™s new, we present Scratch #12-2008, an IPA.
 
The IPA is a fickle beast; too much malt and you veer into a high-octane hopbomb, while too little hops can question a beerâ€™s virility. In these chaotic days of shrinking hop harvests, balance is key to a proper IPA. Scratch #12-2008 delivers an intense pine nose married with a subtle wildflower aroma. The Thames Valley yeast adds an earthy nod to traditional English IPAs, while the American hops provide a bold contrasting bitterness.
 
Breath deep, relax, enjoy."
Jupiler,1,5.2,"Jupiler is the most famous and most popular beer in Belgium. This delicious lager is brewed with the finest ingredients (malt, maize, water, hop, yeast), using undisputed craftsmanship, ensuring an outstanding beer quality.

Gordon,1,8.7,"Gordon is a hybrid version of strong ale, somewhere between an Imperial Red and a Double IPA. We make it with six different malts and three types of hops, then dry-hop it with a mutha lode of Amarillo hops. It is 8.7% alcohol by volume, and has 85 International Bittering Units. 

It features a gooey, resiny aroma and a luscious mouthfeel. Gordon is brewed with dash of chocolate malt in it, to round out its load of hops and balance the beer. The result is an assertive yet exceptionally smooth version of strong beer.

We brew Gordon in tribute to the late Gordon Knight. In addition to opening some of Coloradoâ€™s first microbreweries, Knight was a Vietnam vet, grade-A citizen, and huge promoter of craft beer. He lost his life in 2002 while fighting a wild fire outside of Lyons, Colorado.

Originally our winter seasonal beer, it has become a cult favorite of extreme-beer lovers, so we now brew occasional batches of Gordon throughout the year. Released in bottles in 2003 and 2004, Gordon is now sold in four packs of hand-labeled cans and on draft in select markets.

Dale's Pale Ale,1,6.5,"Dale's Pale Ale is our flagship beer and America's first hand-canned craft beer. It's an assertive but deftly balanced beer (somewhere between an American pale ale and an India Pale Ale) brewed with hefty amounts of European malts and American hops.

It features a merengue-like head, a copper color, and a hoppy nose, thanks to a big post-boil addition of Centennial hops. To complement its hoppy first impression, Dale's also sports a rich middle of malts and hops, and a bracing finish. Dale's is 6.5% alcohol by volume, and features 65 International Bittering Units.

We think of it as the perfect, everyday beer for hopheads like us. Dale's Pale Ale's rich flavor has helped us make many new fans, and its numerous honors have helped us kick huge holes in the misconceptions regarding cans."
Old Chub,1,8,"Old Chub is a Scottish strong ale brewed with hearty amounts of seven different malts, including crystal and chocolate malts, and a smidge of US and UK hops. Old Chub also gets a dash of beechwood-smoked grains imported from Bamburg, Germany, home of the world's greatest smoked beers. Old Chub is 8% alcohol by volume.  While Dale's satisfies our hop addiction, Old Chub takes care of our deep affections for malt.  The cola-colored beer (almost black) features a tan head, a creamy, skim-milk mouthfeel, and rich, semi-sweet flavors of caramel and chocolate throughout. The addition of smoked grains gives Old Chub a delicate kiss of smoke on the finish.  Old Chub is the beer equivalent of a lightly smoked single malt scotch, or your favorite dark chocolate. We call it Rocky Mountain Mutha's Milk. People who tell us defiantly, \I don't drink dark beer"
Ten Fidy,1,10,"Ten FIDY Imperial Stout - Now (11-21-07) available in cans, our winter seasonal beer is immensely viscous and loaded with neck-deep flavors of chocolate, malt, coffee, cocoa and oats.

It's the beer equivalent of decadently rich milkshake made with malted-milk balls and Heavenâ€™s best chocolate ice cream. Ten FIDY is about 10% ABV and is made with enormous amounts of two-row malts, chocolate malts, roasted barley, flaked oats and hops. Its huge-but-comforting flavors hide a whopping 98 IBUs that are deftly tucked underneath the beerâ€™s mountains of malty goodness.

Ten FIDY is the ultimate Rocky Mountain winter warmer, and further proof of the creative muscle of our beloved brewing staff. Look for fourpacks of Ten FIDY in select beer stores in Colorado. Out of state? We hope to send a few cases to a few of our other states in early '08."

Parking Violation,1,5.6,"Wouldn't it suck to have a job where nobody likes you? And, regardless of your name, people always call you Rita, as in \Lovely Rita?\"" Sometimes people just shorten it to the simpler \""meter maid.\"" The funny thing about that is the Webster dictionary defines a \""meter maid\"" as \""a female member of a police department who is assigned to write tickets for parking violations.\"" You have to wonder how the male \""meter maids\"" feel about that! Parking Violation is an American style pale ale using lots of American hops"
Beer Esteem,1,5.6,"\If you can't feel good about your beer... what else is worth feeling good about.\""

Mars - Belgian Imperial Red IPA,1,8.7,"Named after the Roman god of war, Mars radiates red color and brilliant beauty yet enrages the taste buds with wrathful force.

Earth - Belgian Style Chocolate Milk Stout,1,5,Mother Earth is the rich fertile â€œlivingâ€ planet. Our EARTH combines pale and dark malts for essential body. Cocoa nibsâ€”decadent chocolate in its most elemental formâ€”add distinction. Lush lactose creates incredible creaminess. But Earth gains amazing ground with extensive aging on Bergenfield extra dark cocoa.
Mercury - Belgian Style Small Beer,1,6.5,"Messenger of the gods, Mercury symbolizes commerce, travel, thievery, wit and wealth. MERCURY cleverly stole its essence from mistress lover VENUS.

Lust,1,11.5,"LUST Belgian-style Dark Strong Ale stirs shameless desire in men (and women) with its captivating appearance, enticing aroma and satisfying flavors.

The pleasure you derive from this dark beer is beyond words. 

LUST. Regret. Repent. Repeat."
Pride,1,6.5,"RIDE Belgian-style Strong Pale Ale boasts a glorious deep gold color and an amazing yet arrogant head. Plentiful pale malt creates beautiful, agile body. Assertive hops and Belgian yeast achieve charismatic floral and spice notes in aroma and flavor. But Prideâ€™s predominant and unique character comes from its exposure to Brettanomyces in French oak Chardonnay barrels. At once tart and refreshing yet earthy and musty, Pride is unlike most beers on earth. And itâ€™s bitter, lingering finish demands another sip. 

Awarded a BRONZE medal at World Beer Cup 2008, Pride has much too much to boast about."
Sloth,1,10.2,"SLOTH Belgian-style Imperial Stout is deliberately dark as hell. The pour is slow and sluggish. Its head is menacing, becoming torn and tattered Belgian lace on the sides of the glass as you cautiously consume this brewâ€”sip by insidious sip. 

The aroma is sweet from heavy malt and big alcohol with notes of vanilla, coconut and whiskey from the oak. The depth & breadth of roasted malt flavors loiters on the palate while the robust finish lingers, well, forever. 

SLOTH...Just add couch."
Wrath,1,8.2,"WRATH Belgian-style Double IPA is fiercely bitter with notes of spice and earth. Its fury slowly and purposefully unfurls on the tongue, relentlessly bringing on more and more enraged flavor with each sip. 

Wrath wreaks havoc on your taste buds. Anything you drink after this may as well be water."
Greed,1,5,"With a summer release in mind, GREED Belgian-style Single was created miserlyâ€”relatively speakingâ€”with one type of malt and two varieties of hops. At 5% ABV and 30 IBUs, Greed is the lightest in our series of 2007 Deadly Sin Beers. However, the Belgian yeast used in fermentation and conditioning contributes an earthy, somewhat spicy flavor and a crisp finish. We invite you to be greedy before itâ€™s gone. 

GREED...Less [for you] is More [for me]."
Envy,1,7,"ENVY Imperial Pilsner obsessively desires to be better than the worldâ€™s most common lager. Envy vies for attention with its beautifully bright, golden color and tightly-formed crown.

This beer was brewed using only American malts, American hops, and American yeast. Who says you have to import ingredients from Germany to make a true Pilsner?

Of course, this Pilsner is made â€œTerrapin Styleâ€. Hence the 75 B.U.â€™s, the 7.5% alcohol and the term â€œIMPERIAL Pilsnerâ€."
Apricot Wheat,1,4.9,"Our easy drinking wheat beer is light in color and body ... perfect for those looking for a lighter taste.

We delicately blend chocolate and caramel malts with four others to make this flavorful, easy drinking beer.

This red ale gets its distinctive color from a healthy portion of caramel malt, which also lends some body and sweetness to the beer. The predominant flavor and aroma of this beer, however, is brought to you by the fresh American hops. If you haven't done so yet, treat yourself to Ithaca Beer's new monstrously hoppy Red Ale."

Southern Tier Porter,1,5.2,"Porter is our darkest beer, but not necessarily our strongest.  It is widely held that the darker the beer, the stronger the beer, but this is a summarily false.  The contribution of color comes directly from the color of malt that we use.  Some malt is oasted to achieve dark color and coffee-like flavor which in turn get transferred to the beer.

Our Porter is ruchly complex with overtones of chocolate and expresso beans followed by a subtle flavor of hops.  It's a nourishing beer without being too sweet or filling."
Southern Tier Tripel,1,9,"Don't let Tripel's light color and delicate aroma fool you, this is one serious beer brewed with maximum effort.  First, we introduce the freshest barley to crystal filtered water.  Second, we add the best hops shipped directly from Europe.  Third, our special yeast is the catalyst for fermentations, gobbling sugar and creating alcohol as it works.  

Some say that the Belgian monks who first brewed this style called it triple to denote it's high alcohol content.  Still others believe triple's origins lay in its triple fermentations; twice in the brewery and once in the bottle.  Whatever the answer, ours is the Tripel threat."

Terrapin Monk's Revenge,1,9.8,"This Belgian IPA has a malt bill of a Belgian Tripel and a hop bill of a Double IPA. The yeast I chose for this beer comes from one of the 7 Trappist breweries.

Believe it or not, this is the first time in my professional brewing career that I have used dextrose (corn syrup) in a Terrapin brew. True to style no doubt.

â€œMonkâ€™s Revengeâ€ (otherwise known as the â€œBig Nastyâ€) has all the flavor and aroma of a Double IPA while hidden beneath lies the malt character of a fine Belgian Tripel.

I hope you enjoy my interpretation of this very fun style."

Scratch #14 2008,1,6.7,"Scratch #14-2008 is our interpretation of a farmhouse aleâ€”a once near-extinct winter-brewed (and summerâ€“imbibed) Belgian ale.

Our celebratory brew starts with a black pepper and ginger nose. The nicely carbonated brew releases a honey-malt flavor that gives way to a tart crisp finish that masks the elevated ABV.

We use a blended yeast strain (Saison Dupont & Le Chouffe) to create the traditional peppery, spicy earthy flavors of the saison. Slight hints of ginger also come through in the finish.

Drink it â€˜til the wedding bells chime!"

Huge portions of pale and specialty malts give this mammoth brew a complex yet exceptionally smooth palate. Hops provide balance without overpowering the chewy malt profile."
Bengali Tiger,1,6.5,"Sixpoint Bengali Tiger is reminiscent of the century-old English IPA. In my perspective, many current IPAs suffer from lacking substance; unbalanced by a hoppy assertiveness that is not substantiated by a strong foundation of rich malt flavors. Our interpretation uses the highest-quality, floor-malted base malt, which lends a full-bodied and rich caramel flavor. We mash at high temperatures and add generous amounts of specialty malts to further emphasize a strong foundation of malt as leverage for our generous additions of hopsâ€¦ Which are indeed generous. We use a total of three different hop strains, and add a total of six different additions throughout the process. The Bengali Tiger has a hoppy snap upfront, but strides at a steady pace, and finishes balanced. The signature characteristic of the Tiger is the aromaâ€¦ we use massive quantities of whole East Kent Goldings hops to dry hop in our conditioning tanks. The result? The essential oils from the hops are an enticing treat before every sip. Notice the lacing of stripes around the pint glass as you finish your glass; itâ€™s the mark of the Tiger."
Ridgeline Amber,1,5.4,"Ridgeline Amber stands out as a stellar, complex choice in a sea of over-simplified amber beers available today.

A touch of hops rounds out its silky, full body, highlighting Ridgelineâ€™s subtle but engrossing character. Show your friends that you care about their taste buds by turning them on to our imminently balanced and perfectly complex Ridgeline Amber.

Wild Raspberry Ale,1,5.6,"What better way to surprise a beer lover than with a fruit beer that tastes like beer? Nine years ago, we began our quest to provide beer lovers with a worthy fruit beer, by rolling out Wild Raspberry Ale. Our mantra is that real fruit makes real beer, so we ferment Wild Raspberry Ale with hundreds of pounds of real red and black raspberries. We steadfastly refuse to fall prey to extracts and cheap syrups. Sure, squirting syrup into a keg of beer and rolling it around on the floor is easy, but the taste is...  fake! Over the past nine years, we have stayed true to our commitment to real fruit, no matter what the time, expense, or late season frosts have thrown our way. One year, Mother Nature delivered a late cold snap that was so severe, we had to pre-order 85% of the harvestable U.S. black raspberry crop, just to meet the demand for Wild Raspberry Ale.

Our efforts do not go unrewarded â€“ Wild Raspberry Ale is a truly effervescent, ruby red ale that achieves the almost impossible balance between malted barley and tart raspberry fruitiness. Its naturally tart character makes Wild Raspberry the ultimate accompaniment to spicy Mexican food or on its own as a stand-alone session beer."

Hops produce an overabundance of hop cones and we were there for the picking. Even after 22 lbs, we hardly put a dent in the yield! So...here we are 3 weeks later, the beer is on tap and it is the freshest...hoppiest...flavorful beer you can imagine! Needless to say, we are proud of this beauty from the ground, up! We wanted a full-flavored IPA, so Bryan suggested we use our Requiem IPA recipe, and calculate for fresh, whole hop cones. Worked beautifully!! We ended up with an IPA with so much up-front flavor you would think you are enjoying a high octane Imperial! Instead, this is a middle-of-the-road IPA, at 5.2% abv!! This just goes to show how a hugely flavorful IPA can be loaded-up with fresh ingredients and come out the other end, a tasty LOW octane, treat!

Relax and watch the evening arrive as the afternoon sun is consumed by the illuminating moon over the gardens. We brewed Avant Garde for you, our friends and families. Hereâ€™s to things worth guarding over."
Lost and Found Abbey Ale,1,7.5,"Lost and Found- Modeled after the great Trappist and Monastic beers that inspired the founding of our brewery. A richly deep garnet colored ale created from a blend of Domestic and imported malts. As part of our commitment to interesting brewing endeavors, Chef Vince created a special raisin puree for this beer. Malts, raisins and a fantastic yeast strain working in harmony produce a beer of amazing complexity and depth. Available in 750ml bottles and on draft at select inspired locations."
Red Barn Ale,1,6.7,"This Farmhouse Ale traces its roots to the small rustic breweries of Southern Belgium. The word Saison comes to us from the French language and it means Season. Lightly spiced with Organic Ginger, Orange Peels, Black Pepper and Grains of Paradise, this brew promises to quench your thirst on the hottest Southern California days or wherever your travels may take you. Available in 750 ml bottles and on draft at select inspired locations."
Judgement Day,1,10.5,"A massive beer in every sense of the word. A stronger and more contemplative version of our Lost and Found Ale. Judgment Day is the base beer for our Cuvee de Tomme. Many of the Trappist Breweries produce a version of beer which ages incredibly well for many years to come. And, since none of us knows when the end of the world is coming, we suggest you stock up with lots of Lost Abbey beers so that when the end of the world magically appears from no where, youâ€™ll have a beer or two on hand for even the stingiest of angels. Available in 750ml bottles and on draft at select inspired locations."
Devotion,1,6.25,"Itâ€™s an unassuming road leading to the priory. Here, off the corner of two intersecting roads, dedicated monks have been making beer for over 150 years. Itâ€™s always been a simple life â€“ the kind that requires they brew only enough to sustain the activities of their monastery. In the silence of passing seasons, they pray, they brew and retire in solitary existence behind the sheltering walls. They live a most interesting life. Most likely one we couldnâ€™t sustain.

Nearby, each summer, the trellised fields spring to life as rows of resinous green cones are trained toward the heavens. Rumor is some monks love these hops and being surrounded by budding yellow aromas and the leafy pungent fields inspired them. Since we arenâ€™t sensible enough to locate our brewery near hop fields, we can only offer this blond ale in celebration of our Abbey brethren and their steadfast Devotion."
Serpents Stout,1,10.5,The history of the bible and religion is indeed the struggle of good vs. evil. Our Serpentâ€™s Stout recognizes the evil of the dark side that we all struggle with. This is a massively thick and opaque beer that begs the saints to join the sinners in their path to a black existence. 10.5% ABV and available in 750 ml bottles and on draft at select locations.
Oktoberfest,1,5.5,"Please enjoy Brooklyn Oktoberfest, a rich, malty version of the beer brewed for the fall festival which originated in Germany with the betrothal of the Crown Prince of Bavaria in 1810. Brooklyn Oktoberfest is in the marzen style, an amber lager beer brewed in March and stored cold through the summer for sale in autumn."
Daas Organic Blond,1,6.5,"Daas Blond is the authentic Belgian strong golden beer, its honey spice aroma and perfect balance of bitter sweet flavours are followed by a classic dry hop finish.  A perfect aperitif beer.

Daas Beer is the only Belgian beer brewed in Belgium to carry both the  UK Soil Assoc organic certification and the Belgian Certsys certification whist still upholding its Belgian tradition of brewing excellence using the finest organic ingredients."
Daas Organic Witte,1,5,The Daas Organic Witte is very well received by women beer drinkers; it is a naturally cloudy Belgian wheat beer. Its fruity blend of subtle citrus (baked oranges) and spice (coriander) flavors compliment its crispy dry and bitter hop finish.
Saison Athene,1,0,"A bottle conditioned Saison with a spicy and moderately hoppy profile true to the traditions of the farmhouse ales of Wallonia.

 A spiced saison with chamomile, rosemary and black pepper."
Lectio Divina,1,0,"Brewed in the spirit of the abbey ales of Belgium. Brewed with the same care and attention to the Art of Brewing that is practiced in the monastic breweries of Belgium.

A Belgian inspired amber. This beer gets itâ€™s color from the candi sugar, as it is made without dark or crystal malts."
Turbodog,1,0,"Abita Turbodog is a dark brown ale brewed with Willamette hops and a combination of British pale, crystal and chocolate malts.

This combination gives Turbodog its rich body and color and a sweet chocolate-toffee like flavor. Turbodog began as a specialty ale but has gained a huge loyal following and has become one of our three flagship brews.

Just a bit stronger than our other brews, so . . .beware of the dog!"
Local 1,1,9,"In Williamsburg, Brooklyn, we forge barley malt and hops from Germany, aromatic raw sugar from Mauritius and yeast from Belgium into our latest beer, Brooklyn Local 1.

Behind the full golden color you'll find an alluring aroma, a dynamic complex of flavors, Belgian flair, Brooklyn fortitude and a dusting of our special yeast. To create this beer, we use the old technique of 100% bottle re-fermentation, a practice now rare even in Europe. It gives this beer a palate of unusual depth. Enjoy it locally or globally, as an aperitif or with your favorite dishes. It is particularly nice with spicy seafood and with fine cheeses."
Pipeline Porter,1,0,"Pipeline Porter is smooth and dark with a distinctive roasty aroma and earthy complexity from its diverse blends of premium malted barley. This celebration of malt unites with freshly roasted 100% Kona coffee grown at Cornwell Estate on Hawaiiâ€™s Big Island, lending a unique roasted aroma and flavor. A delicate blend of hops rounds out this palate-pleasing brew."
NÃ¸gne Ã˜ Wit,1,4.5,This Belgian Ale is what you could call a wit with an attitude.  We are generous with all our ingredients - including both orange peel and coriander.  This does not stop this ale from being a good companion with seafood dishes.
NÃ¸gne Ã˜ Bitter,1,4.5,"A light session ale, with an assertive hop aroma of E K Golding.  Great beer to pair with lots of different food - a good allround."
Havre Stout,1,4.5,"We usually do not make compromises, but this is probably the exception.  Norwegians are dead scared of dark beers.  This is an attempt to show that there are gentle dark ales.  As such Havre Stout is smooth and drinkable."
NÃ¸gne Ã˜ Saison,1,6.5,"One of our most refreshing brews, made for those hot summer days, but satisfying year 'round. Recommended serving temperature 8Â°C/45Â°F. Goes well with seafood, particularly oysters."
NÃ¸gne Ã˜ Amber Ale,1,6,"A rather malty brew, which we think goes very well with cheeses - even well matured blue cheeses. You can also try our Amber paired with a grilled dish. Recommended serving temperature 10Â°C/50Â°F."
NÃ¸gne Ã˜ Imperial Brown Ale,1,7.5,"There is a long story to this malty ale.  It was first brewed in the spring 2006 in NÃ¸rrebro Bryghus in Copenhagen, Denmark, as a joint brew between NÃ¸gne Ã˜ and NÃ¸rrebro.  NÃ¸rrebro calls their version â€œDouble Knot Brownâ€.  It is the perfect thing to drink with almost any cheese."
NÃ¸gne Ã˜ India Pale Ale,1,6.5,"A rich, malty, and very bitter ale. Cascade hops provide a long, fruity, and spicy after-taste.  Recommended serving temperature 10Â°C/50Â°F.  Ideal with barbequed or smoked meat dishes."
NÃ¸gne Ã˜ #100,1,10,"Our 100th batch, brewed for the enjoyment of the brewers, but popular demand forced us to release it commercially.  This malty, yet light bodied ale has a massive hop bitterness.  Most enjoyable in a comfortable chair in front of a roaring fire."
Krampus Imperial Helles Lager,1,9,"St. Nicholas, aka Santa Claus, is a magical figure, the bringer of gifts and an icon of holiday spirit. Forgotten by most is his evil side kick and enforcer of â€˜the listâ€™. European tradition says while St. Nick is busy delivering presents to good little boys and girls, Krampus hands out punishments to the bad. A fanged, goat-horned bully, the Christmas Devil uses sticks and chains to beat the naughty children. Dark malts and aromatic hops create the diabolical spirit of this brew. It is finished with lager yeast and aged cold for no less than 30 days. This Imperial Helles Lager will warm even the darkest hearts. 

This season, replace the cookies with a bottle of Krampus. If he happens to pay a visit, toast to him with this devilish brew. Merry Kramp-mas to all, and to all a good pint!

Scratch #15 2008,1,6,"Scratch #15-2008 is our first collaborative beer in the Scratch series. We teamed up with St. Thomas Roasters of Linglestown to create a Double Espresso Oatmeal Stout.

The double in the name refers to the espresso (not the alcohol). Scratch #15â€™s espresso blend is a medium city-type roast featuring beans from three continents. St. Thomas Roasters roasted and ground the beans; we used them in our hopback. At the end of the boil the hot wort passed through the espresso beans to give a lush coffee espresso nose and hints of coffee flavor.

Chocolate, roasted and caramel malt flavors stand out, while the addition of oats gives Scratch #15 a full, round mouth feel. Galena and Ken Goldings hops are added to balance the overall flavor and not drive up the bitterness. The head retention diminishes quickly because of the oils from the espresso beans."
Port Panzer Imperial Pilsner,1,9.5,
Chico Estate Harvest Ale,1,6.7,"We wanted to see if we could grow hops at our brewery in Chico, California so we planted our own hop field selecting our prized Cascade and Centennial varieties along with some specialty hop varieties to experiment with. To our surprise, we not only could grow hops, we were also able to harvest them in late summer due to Chicoâ€™s ideal climate. 

Chico Estate Harvest Ale is one of the very few estate harvest ales produced anywhere in the world today. All the hops in the beer are grown naturally on the premises of our brewery in Chico. We pick the hops ourselves and then take them directly to the brew kettle, without being dried, just after picking so they retain nearly all of their natural oils and resins. It is made with Cascade, Centennial and Chinook hops. Until now, this beer has only been available in draft. Starting this year, we will be bottling it on a very limited basis, with plans to expand its availability as we expand our Chico hop field in the coming years."
Southern Hemisphere Harvest Fresh Hop  Ale,1,6.7,"Our newest addition to our Harvest family is Southern Hemisphere Harvest. This is the first time we know of that an American brewer has put out a beer with fresh-picked hops from the southern hemisphere. The inaugural ale will debut in late April and will feature fresh Pacific Hallertau, New Zealand Motueka and New Zealand Southern Cross hops, all from New Zealand. 

Like our Celebration Ale, the fresh hops in this beer are dried right after being picked then shipped immediately to Chico for brewing so that they retain their peak aromatics and flavors. To ensure the freshest hops possible, we went to the added expense of flying these hops from New Zealand to Chico so we could brew with them the week after they were picked."
Pays du Soleil,1,8,Amber ale with Palmetto berries and hibiscus.
Alpha,1,6.2,"Alpha, the first entry in our one-off, brewer's choice series is a Belgian-style Pale Ale at 6.2% ABV. Brewed with Pale, Carahell and Wheat malts, Amarillo and Cascade hops. This medium bodied beer is crisp on the palate with a smooth, not overly bitter hops flavor coupled with the fruity esters from the Belgian Abby yeast strain we used. Its bottle and keg conditioned, so expect a tall, fluffy head, and perhaps small amount of sediment. Just one batch was brewed in April 2008, kegs released in late May, and only 20 cases of bottles for sale only at the brewery at the special debut night event of June 13, 2008, from 5 to 8 pm. Recipe by Jeff Musselman, assistant brewer."
Bravo,1,6.5,"As for Bravo, according to Head Brewer, Chris Wilson, the base of the beer comes from pale, wheat, and crystal malts and features some roasted barley while Pilgrim and Hallertauer make up the light hop profile."

Baron Pilsner,1,4.7,"Our pilsner is a traditional Northern German Style Pilsner. It has a fantastic malty aroma with a slight spice from the hops. The head is brilliant white and floats on the clean pale lager. The sparkling mouthfeel gives way to a soft malt sweetness that is followed by a long, dry, crisp finish. The balanced clean finish taunts the mouth to take another drink. Lagered for a minimum of 8-12 weeks to ensure smoothness and drinkability.

All ingredients for the beer are imported from Germany. Brewed in accordance to the German Beer Purity Law (Reinheitsgebot) of 1516."
Baron Schwarzbier,1,4.9,"The Baron Schwarzbier is a classic German black lager, deep black with ruby and brown highlights. At first the Schwarzbier starts with a slight roasty nose and taste, followed by a faint chocolate-malty body with a very crisp, clean, lagered finish. Lagered for an average of 10-12 weeks to provide a very smooth, easy drinking Schwarzbier with full flavor provided by the dark malts. 

All ingredients for the beer are imported from Germany. Brewed in accordance to the German Beer Purity Law (Reinheitsgebot) of 1516."
Baron Oktoberfest,1,0,"The Baron Oktoberfest is a traditional German Style Oktoberfest / Marzen. Deep copper/amber in color with a rich but light malt flavor. Finishes crisp and easy, leaving the mouth desiring more. We age the Oktoberfest for a full three months to guarantee a fantastically smooth beer.

All ingredients for the beer are imported from Germany. Brewed in accordance to the German Beer Purity Law (Reinheitsgebot) of 1516."
Baron Helles Bock,1,6.4,"The Helles-Bock is similar to a traditional Maibock. Bocks are traditionally brewed in the winter / early spring months and are served during the spring / early summer months. The Helles Bock has a copper golden color with a brilliant white head. The body showcases a clean sweet maltiness that is offset by just enough hops to balance it. Very smooth and easy, drinkable yet deceptive at 6.4%.

All ingredients for the beer are imported from Germany. Brewed in accordance to the German Beer Purity Law (Reinheitsgebot) of 1516."
HofbrÃ¤u Oktoberfestbier,1,6.3,"HofbrÃ¤u brews a rich, full-bodied beer which goes down ideally with traditional Bavarian cuisine. With its deliciously bitter taste and alcoholic content of 6.3% volume, HofbrÃ¤u Oktoberfestbier is as special as the Beer Festival itself.

Type: Bottom-fermented, light festive beer"

mesmerizing potion. Pour this tantalizing brew into a snifter and seek solace in the depths of its fascinating flavors. Cinnamon, nutmeg and cloves seem familiar but this brew is cloaked in deep, dark secrets that will forever haunt you.

This beer is like nothing you have ever experienced. It is a majestic mÃ©lange of rich, impressive flavors that meld wonderfully with the
warmth of alcohol. Will it appease or awaken your spirit?"
Obliteration IV,1,8.7,"With passion and purpose, we present this series of hop-centric beers. Using different hop varieties and brewing techniques, we aim to capture bold, distinct hop characteristics in aroma, flavor and finish. While we explore the
world of hops, we invite you to learn along with us: these beers offer an incredible opportunity to experience the diversity of hops while engaging the palate and obliterating the senses.

Obliteration IV is a tremendous Double Wheat beer. Its aroma is pungent with fragrant notes of citrus, spice, pine and alcohol. An even malt-to-wheat ratio provides a sturdy yet satisfying base for showcasing these high alpha-acid hops, creating flavors and textures that entice then intrigue. An American wheat beer yeast allows Obliteration IV to finish with unadulterated hop bitterness."
Samuel Adams Blackberry Witbier,1,5.5,"We brewed this traditional witbier with orange peel and coriander, and then added a hint of blackberry.

Only 25 barrels of this beer were brewed."
Pugsley's Signature Series Imperial Porter,1,7.1,"Imperial Porter is a full bodied, very dark, malty beer with a good roasted character coming from the Crystal, Chocolate and Black Patent Malts used in the mash.

The beer has an OG of 1.070, rounding out after fermentation with just a slight residual sweetness and cutting dry at the finish."
Pugsley's Signature Series Barley Wine Style Ale,1,8.5,"Barley Wine Style Ale is a big beer made with six different malts (Pale Ale, Crystal, Caramunich, Wheat, Chocolate and Roasted Barley) and balanced with a very full hop charge of Summit, Challenger and Fuggles hops.

Yellowtail Pale Ale,1,4.6,"So where can you taste a Kolsch? There are no Kolsches being imported into the United States. So you could fly to Cologne. A better idea is to come to Ballast Point Brewing Company and try our Yellowtail Pale Ale Kolsch. We make it with 5% Wheat, finish hop it with Liberty and Tettnanger hops, and ferment it with a yeast we borrowed from a brewery in Cologne. So come on in and enjoy a taste of the Rhineland!!"

The most famous examples are brewed in Burton on Trent.  This hard water gives these beer a pleasantly dry bitter finish"
Black Marlin Porter,1,6,Ballast Point Black Marlin Porter is a rich dark chocolaty Porter with a distinctive American hop character.  It is a great beer to go with hearty foods and is surprisingly one of the few beers that goes well with dessert. One of our favorite combinations here at Ballast Point is Black Marlin Porter with apple pie a la mode.
Wahoo Wheat Beer,1,4,"Ballast Point Wahoo Wheat Beer is created using the same ingredients that were once used in Belgium. Flaked unmalted wheat, oats and malted barley comprise the grain. The unmalted wheat has a high protein content, which causes the beer to be hazy, thus giving it a cloudy, or \white\"" appearance. A special yeast gives a refreshing tangy flavor that is different from both the sour Weiss beers of Berlin or the banana and clovey Weizens of Bavaria. The mild hopping allows the unique malts to show through and does not conflict with the subtleties of the citrus spicing. This unique citrus character is created by adding a blend of curacao (bitter orange)"
Orange Blossom Pilsner Â²,1,11,"When you make a pot of coffee, but only use half the water, you get some pretty rich coffee. That's the approach we took with our latest offering. OBP Squared, with half the water, has 11% alcohol by volume-twice that of original OBP.

The result is a bold, distinct taste of its own. Made with twice as much real orange blossom honey, all-natural ingredients and no refined sugar, it really is the new king bee of beers."
Yakima Twilight,1,8.9,"The tenacious grip of big, juicy hop aroma and character slides smoothly into rich, dark malts. This heavyweight battle between fresh, Yakima Valley hops and dark, roasted malts is resolved harmoniously as the flavors merge to deliver complex satisfaction with a warming edge. Enjoy the â€˜twilightâ€™ for the bright and brassy hops!"

Weyerbacher Fireside Ale,1,7.5,
Little Creatures Pilsner,1,4.6,"Czech Saaz hops are added early in the boil with a late hopping using a hybrid variety we keep to ourselves, giving light flavour and a soft bitterness. Lightly kilned pilsner malt gives the beer both itâ€™s light, slightly golden colour, and leaves a crisp clean taste on the palate."
Phoenix,1,5,"A polished, golden yellow beer with 5% alcohol. Phoenix beer is pasteurised after bottling, according to natural conservation methods. The quality of the underground water also allows us to produce a beer with no chemicals additives. Time of maturation before distribution is meticulously controlled."
Phuket Lager,1,5,"Phuket Beer was created as a refreshing â€˜boutiqueâ€™ beer in view of the exotic island of Phuket with a much lower formula of bitterness than any other domestic rivals in Thailand.

Phuket Beer is the first regional beer brewed in Thailand and is positioned to appeal to both the international markets as well as the local population. This is manifested through the label and packaging designs presented in both English and Thai languages.

Phuket Beer is well positioned as a premium brand located somewhere between the local standard brands and the imported premium brands. The efforts were inspired from the feeling of being in a tropical paradise. Thai beer consumers have become more sophisticated over the years, by selecting and demanding premium and high-end beers. initial consumer target was Phuket Island's significant tourist sector, a sector that is prone to taste and drink locally produced brands.However, strategic positioning and selected marketing of Phuket Beer has resulted in a ray of successful export markets with overwhelming response from the initial markets overseas.

The philosophy is to provide a â€˜tropical lifestyleâ€™ drinking experience in a fresh clean light tasting lager beer with 5% alcohol by volume, which is in total contrast to the other Thai beers that are very bitter with higher alcohol content."
Monteith's Summer Ale,1,5,"Monteithâ€™s Summer Ale is a refreshingly different beer. The opportunity to rediscover some flavour highlights of beer styles enjoyed on summer days past, and bring them back to life.

At the end of last century, in England, Europe and the Americas and in New Zealand, there was still an adherence to brew with barley, wholesome grains, hops and other traditional brewing spices.

Monteithâ€™s Summer Ale is a bright gold beer with great body from four different malts. Spiced with a single hop variety and a touch of history - a little Rata honey. Subtle, but enough to make all the difference. The result is a truly refreshing herbal spiced beer brewed for the Summer Season â€” a splendid thirst quencher.

Monteithâ€™s Summer Ale enjoyed ice-cold with a simple range of fruits, perhaps refreshing wedge of orange or lime. Alternatively, match with summer salads and stir-frys to complement the light flavours."
Monteith's Celtic Beer,1,4.4,"Monteithâ€™s Celtic Beer is considered an â€˜Irish-style aleâ€™ in the heritage of beers of a burnt-red colour traditionally brewed in the Emerald Isle.

Monteithâ€™s Celtic Beer has a dry roasted malt flavour characteristic of this style of brewing. This malty characteristic and crisp dryness is derived from malts of the roasted chocolate malt style. The hop character is medium to allow the chocolate malts to show through.

Monteithâ€™s brewers have been able to develop traditional ale fermentation characters while allowing the interesting roasted malt notes to come through in the aroma."
Scharer's Lager,1,5,"A traditional German-style lager, fermented at 7-9Â°C and lagered at 4Â°C for 4-6 weeks. The storage produces a soft, natural carbonation. Full-bodied with high bitterness and hop flavour and a dry finish. Hoppy aromatic nose. Available on draught or in 780 mL champagne-style bottles. Can be difficult to acquire."
Epic Pale Ale,1,5.4,Supreme Champion Beer - New Zealand International Beer Awards
Seven Gates Pale Ale,1,5.6,"The story of the Seven Gates comes from rural Pennsylvania, not far from the Spring House Brewery. According to the legend, a mental asylum for the criminally insane stood in the middle of a dense forest. Surrounding the asylum were seven concentric gates, preventing would-be escapees. One terrifying night, the asylum caught fire, test link causing the inmates to flee into the menacing forest. As the tale goes, the former asylum residents were trapped by the seven gates, and eventually succumbed to the perils of the forest. The locals swear that the tormented souls of the inmates will torture anyone brave enough to attempt passage through the Seven Gates of the forest.

Spring House Brewing Co. honors the local legend by producing a terrifyingly delicious brew that is as familiar as a friendly forest, yet possesses a mysterious quality that will haunt you from the first taste. The enormous, hopped flavor and the meticulous craftsmanship that goes into each bottle will have you believing that the master brewer must be a direct descendent of the former asylum residents."

Sprecher Pub Ale,1,4.5,"Seven varieties of malted barley are combined to give this English-style ale its complex flavor and deep, brown color. A select British yeast culture adds a subtle fruitiness and a blend of choice hops gives this non-bitter ale a soft finish."
Sprecher Irish Stout,1,5.73,"This tribute to St. Patrick's Day is smooth and creamy, with distinctive flavors and aromas reminiscent of bitter-sweet chocolate and dark coffee. Just one precious batch of this robust, ebony colored stout is brewed each year."
Scratch #16 2008,1,6.3,"Scratch #16-2008 combines the bitterness of two aroma hops, the lush sweetness of honey and malt and an earthly yeast taste creating a Winter Warmer designed to ward off the coldest days.

The dark, rich amber color comes from a combination of molasses and crystal malts; the Thames Valley brings a distinct earthly flavor; white the blend of hops creates fruity (Amarillo) and piney (Cluster) bitterness.

The Winter Warmer ends with a slight warming sensation from the elevated alcohol content.  Enjoy this one throughout the winter months.  Cheers."
Altbier,1,5.1,"Reddish brown coloring.  Aroma is slightly sweet, much like flavoring.  Very drinkable.  Recommended."
Smuttynose Winter Ale,1,4.8,"Smuttynose Winter Ale is a full-bodied, amber beer brewed with a special Trappist ale yeast. Stylistically reminiscent of a Belgian Abbey Double, it features fruity aromas and flavor, balanced by soft Crystal hops. Warming, mellow & pleasantly complex, Smuttynose Winter Ale is your perfect cold weather companion."
Shoals Pale Ale,1,4.7,"Our interpretation of a classic English beer style is copper-colored, medium-bodied and highly hopped. Its flavor is delightfully complex: tangy fruit at the start, with an assertive hop crispness and a long malty palate that one well-known beer writer has compared to the flavor of freshly-baked bread."
Old Brown Dog Ale,1,5.9,"Old Brown Dog has been cited as a classic example of the â€œAmerican Brown Aleâ€ style of beer. Compared to a typical English Brown Ale, Old Brown Dog is fuller-bodied and more strongly hopped.

Old Brown Dog has been around for many years. It was first brewed in 1988 at the Northampton Brewery. In 1989 it won a silver medal in its category (American Brown Ale) at the Great American Beer Festival in Denver."
Portsmouth Lager,1,5.1,"Named in honor of our hometownâ€™s 375th anniversary, Smuttynose Portsmouth Lager is a full-flavored, medium bodied continental-style beer - deep golden in color, featuring a mouth-pleasing maltiness subtly balanced with spicy imported Saaz hops. One taste of this fine lager tells you this is no ordinary beer: From its mellow, velvety body to its lingering, fresh hop finish, Portsmouth Lager is smooth, complex and satisfying."
Smuttynose Finestkind IPA,1,5.6,"Portsmouth is a colonial era seaport town, so it goes to follow that sooner or later we'd brew an India Pale Ale as a tribute to those big, hoppy 19th century ales that made the long sea voyage from England's temperate shores, 'round the Cape of Good Hope, to the sultry climes of the faraway East Indies.

But there's another reason we brewed this beer, one that's closer to our home and hearts. Hopheads. 

Ten years ago we brewed our first batch of Shoals Pale Ale, our American interpretation of the traditional British ESB (Extra Special Bitter) style. At the time, it was widely considered to be darned hoppy. However, a funny thing happened over the last decade - our Shoals Pale Ale didn't change; beer lovers did, and we started to hear more and more: â€œWhy don't you guys make a really hoppy beer?â€

You could say, then, that Smuttynose IPA is a physical salute to the glory of the American hop grower. The citrusy hop flavor coming from a mixture of Simcoe and Santiams is pleasantly balanced by a smooth bitterness from the Amarillo hops. The beer itself is light bodied and crisp with a golden color that will throw a slight haze, as we bottle it unfiltered. At 65 IBU's, this is definitely not a training-wheels IPA, but is meant for hop lovers looking to satisfy their craving in a way that's not easy to find. We think theyâ€™ll be quite pleased."
Robust Porter,1,5.4,"This hearty, mahogany colored ale is brewed to evoke the dark, full-bodied ales that were a favorite of dockworkers and warehousemen (hence the name â€œPorterâ€) in 19th century London. It is a good bet that when Dickensâ€™ Mr. Pickwick sat down for a pint, we would have been drinking an ale much like our Robust Porter.This is a smooth and very drinkable beer, characterized by its well-balanced malt and hops, plus subtle notes of coffee and chocolate."
Uranus - 100% Brettanomyces Golden Ale,1,7.2,"Uranus, ruler of the heavens, reigns supreme with beauty and brilliance. Gloriously gold in color, URANUS Golden Ale holds title to our first 100% Brettanomyces fermentation and conditioning. Brewed by mere mortals and blessed by the beer gods, this ale deserves to be worshipped."
"Jupiter - Belgian-style \Champagne\"" Trippel""",1,0,
Black Mountain Bitter,1,0,"A style of Pale Ale, Black Mountain Bitter will be lightly hopped with traditional British hop varieties to balance the malt sweetness yet encourage it to tend toward the dry side. We recently received our organic certification from Clemson University after undergoing a rigid inspection and two-month compliance process. Although this represents a big step for Highland, the idea of an all organic product is consistent with our corporate ethos and embrace of natural traditional brewing methods."
Ale To The Chief,1,8.75,\Ale to the Chief! We the Brewers of Avery Brewing Company
White Horse Hefeweizen,1,4.7,"This German inspired wheat ale is packed full of citrus flavor. We use torrified wheat, pale, and carafoam for balance, giving it a nice hazy, straw color and refreshing wheat taste. We ferment the White Horse at higher ale temps with a German style yeast that is known for producing world class wheat beers. We let the yeast take over the majority of the flavoring in our fermenters, providing the beer with banana and clove like esters. We pull some of the yeast with it to give this brew the proper style and to keep its body and character. We than age this brew with zests of citrus and a brewers spice that blends harmoniously with the esters of the yeast and balance out the sweetness of this brew. Truly a favorite in the summer time for breakfast, lunch, or dinner."
"Lovitz Lager \Watermelon Lager\""""",1,4.5,"This summertime lager is both smooth and refreshing as soon as it hits the lips. We take so much pride in it because there is truly nothing else like it on the market. We brew this American Style Lager beer with three types of malt: pilsner, pale and carafoam which enhance the head retention of this beer. We then gingerly scatter some very light floral hops at the beginning to give it some esters and sweetness that compliment the watermelon. The true magic of this beer does not occur in the brewing process but in the conditioning vessel. This is where we add the best farm fresh local watermelon and than push the beer into it, allowing it to sit and saturate for a few weeks. By the time it is complete, we are left with a unbelievably smooth tasting beer with a beautiful aroma and subtle taste of watermelon that imparts its way into this already crisp lager. Truly our customers' favorite, this one will have you reaching for another glass soon after you put the first one down."
Ludwig's Revenge,1,5,"This brew was inspired by the historical burning of our hometown of Chambersburg, PA in July 1864. During the burning, the brewery in town, \Ludwigs Brewery\"" operated by George Ludwig was burned to the ground by Confederate soldiers under Gen. McCausland. In remembrance of this event we created a German style rauchbier"
Truly Honest Ale,1,6,"Our signature brew that started it all. This beer is made with four different specialty malts including two foreign caramel malts, a pale malt, and a toasted malt. These malts impart a subtle toasted/sweet taste. This malty brew is than graced with floral and aroma hops which balance the maltiness of this brew and leaves behind a smooth finish on the palate. Top notch ingredients and a truly \Honest\"" taste makes this a seriously drinkable ale"
Ichabod's Midnight Ride,1,6,"This Belgian style pumpkin ale was inspired by the legendary midnight ride of Ichabod Crane. It is a Belgian style ale complimented by a light touch of pumpkin and spice. Fresh toasted pumpkins are added in the mash with the grains adding a touch of the season to the brew. The complex fruitiness and dryness of the yeast is enhanced by the addition of sugars during fermantation. The beer is lightly spiced with pumpkin spice, all spice, and brown sugar. The pale and toasted malts used, provide a pie crust taste and smell in the beer as the higher alcohol's produced round out the finish."
Daddy Fat Sacs Imperial IPA,1,7.5,"The one and only IPA that doesn't leave your pallet with a bitter after taste. This beer took years of practice to get down and when we finally got it right, we knew it. The beer is made with three malts in considerable additions that leave it with a more malty and sweet taste. There are five different hop additions that were carefully planed out to impart just enough bitterness to give it the body and depth that it needed without leaving you with the astringent and bitter aftertaste. We then added a plethora of English flavor and aroma hops that round out the floral and citrus esters. With the beer being so well balanced between bitter and sweet, we than added \big sacks\"" of bittering hops to the conditioning vessel to impart all the wonderful citrus and floral notes deep into the beer while leaving the bittering aspects of the hop behind. The result was a beer that makes you want to nose dive right in complimented by the well balanced taste of this wonderful brew."""

Liberty Ale,1,6,"San Francisco's famouse Liberty Ale was first brewed on the 18th of April, 1975 to celebrate the 200th anniversary of Paul Revere's historic ride. It is virtually handmade by the brewers of Anchor Steam Beer in one of the smallest and most traditional breweries in the world.

Iniquity Imperial Black Ale,1,9,"The hexagram talisman has been used around the world for centuries to invoke magic and good luck. The sixâ€“point star is also the customary symbol of the brewer, representing the essential aspects of purity: water, hops, grain, malt, yeast, and of course, the brewer. Wishes of good fortune often collaborate with the brewerâ€™s creativity to yield dramatic results. We carefully chose the name for this Imperial India Black Ale, Iniquity â€“ a word opposing goodness. Why? This beer is contrary to what one may expect from an IPA; this is an ale as black as night. It is the antithesis of Unearthly. Some may consider it an immoral act to blacken an ale. We suggest they donâ€™t rely on conventional standards. Allow the darkness to consume you. Cheers!"

Scratch #18 2009,1,7.3,"We started with the same grain bill as Scratch #12 (IPA) and substituted 25% rye for the base malt giving Scratch #18 a creamy mouth feel and a full-bodied taste.

Mount Hood and Chinook hops are combined here for flavoring and aroma, and Warrior hops are used for overall bitterness.

The rye plays off the Mount Hood hops, with both ingredients releasing an herbal, spicy flavor. Cheers."

Trifecta Belgian Style Tripel,1,8.1,"There are hundreds of Trappist Monasteries in the world, many of them make fruitcake. This beer is not made by Monks nor does it resemble fruitcake. Furthermore, Truckee has no Trappist Monastery and that, my friend, is why we at FiftyFifty bring you Trifecta. This is one of FiftyFifty's seasonal ales, and is a high alcohol Belgian style beer. Brewed with inspiration from Belgian Trappist Ales, Trifecta also includes locally grown Purple Sage Honey. With a complex spiciness tempered by the sweeter notes from the sage honey, flavors of spicy sage, alcohol, and mild malt sweetness are apparent, and sage and clove like aromas predominate. Coming in at over 8%, this beer is deceptively strong."

Mamaâ€™s is made with hearty amounts of pale malt, German specialty malts, and a blend of traditional (Saaz) and 21st century Bavarian hops. Our first canned lager, itâ€™s also fermented at cool temperatures with a German yeast.

This tasteful reality Czech is the perfect antidote for the watered-down versions of pilsner clogging Americaâ€™s shelves. And Mamaâ€™s gentle hopping (about 35 IBUs) and low ABV (just 5.3%) mean weâ€™re finally honoring consumer requests for a delicious but less-challenging beer. (Hey, we like a good low-dose session beer, too.) Look for our Gold Metal Winner on US shelves in March.

By utilizing an array of malts, oats, wheat, pure local honey, light European hops and delicately spicing with Grains of Paradise, Madagascar vanilla beans, whole star anise, all brought together with traditional Belgian yeast, the result is a cloudy, deep copper colored, complex experience. This delight to the senses should be served in a 12 ounce footed glass and allowed to warm to 50 degrees to fully gather the malt and spice spectrum."

Yup. 

Researching smoked beers led me to a world of smoked wheat beers, particularly a smoked wheat beer popular in Poland about 100 years ago. (I'll list that one as one of the Blind Bat beers when I'm happy with the test batches and am ready to offer it to the public.) I didn't find anything about smoked wit beers, but decided to experiment a bit (a wit is a wheat beer). I like it, and hope you will too. 

Pictured on the label is Long Island's old Walt Whitman, enjoying a smoke and a book in what is purported to be his favorite spot in his native West Hills. Long Island's springtime is awakening all around him."
Harborfields HefeWeizen,1,4.5,"Sometimes it's good to keep it simple. 

Harborfields HefeWeizen is modeled after the German classic, but meant to be available fresh (like you would enjoy if you were in Germany). Shipping over long distances is not always a friend to beer. 

Named for the Centerport-Greenlawn area of Long Island that is home to the Blind Bat Brewery, Harborfields Hefeweizen goes great with fish, chicken, or a summer salad. Some even like it with brunch! (Please enjoy your waffles responsibly.)"

Samuel Adams Imperial White,1,10.3,"Samuel Adams® Imperial White is a new perspective on the classic witbier style.  Witbiers are normally light and refreshing with a fruity finish and we wanted to see how these characteristics would stand up when we amped up the recipe.  We were totally blown away by the flavors that were created by this beer.

This is not just a more intense version of our spring seasonal Samuel Adams® White Ale.  Imperial White is a new recipe that stands on it own merits.  In fact, it is more of a wine substitute than just another refreshing witbier.  This is a beer that should be sipped and savored and you"

Hop Juice Double IPA,1,9.4,"Here at Left Coast Brewing Co. we pride ourselves on being one of the first breweries to pioneer a Double IPA style beer. In 2003, we brewed our first Double IPA, and haven't looked back since. This hop monster uses Premium American 2- Row and a touch of light crystal malt to create a solid malt foundation. The recipe calls for hops to be used in every step of the brewing process; in the mash, in a hop back, in the fermenter, and in the bright tanks. We use hop extract, hop pellets and hop flowers, hence the name Hop Juice. Hop Juice spends more than 4 weeks dry hopping in the fermenter and the bright beer tank. It is approximately 9.4% abv and has massive IBUs. Hop usage is over 4lbs per barrel. Hopeheads, step up to the plate!"

This golden coloured ale is brewed with a skilful blend of organically grown hops and malt, and pure Scottish water to the exacting standards required by Soil Association Certification Ltd. of the United Kingdom.

Two additional dry hopping regimens employ Ahtanum, Centennial, and Chinook varietals. The resulting beer â€“ not surprisingly â€“ has a hop forward aroma, redolent of peach and apricot. The assertive flavor bursts forth with citrus notes of blood orange and lemon, a caramel malt backbone serves to balance the intensity of the hops. There is little restraint in the flavor of this beer; it is certainly not for the pedestrian palate."
Single-Wide I.P.A.,1,5.7,"The latest addition to the Boulevard family of year-around beers, Single-Wide I.P.A. is our take on a style that originated in 18th century Great Britain. This American version -- inspired by our Smokestack Series Double-Wide I.P.A. -- boasts a heady combination of six varieties of hops, some of which were employed for dry-hopping."

Hoppe Imperial Extra Pale Ale,1,8,"The simplicity of Hoppe tests the skill and ability of the brewer to create something truly majestic. We craft this much like a sculptor who uses only a hammer and chisel to shape stone into a masterpiece. Hoppe is spawned of these few essentials: barley, wheat, hops, yeast and water. This limited palette is an exercise in minimalism, with refined elements which are deliberately selected. This simple combination creates a golden shimmering brew infused with delicate aromas. The artful nature of this beer is exposed with the first taste. As the malt and hops create a composition of flavors, an elegant finish leaves an impression that your tastes will not soon forget."
Gemini Imperial Blended Ale,1,10.5,"High in the winter sky, two parallel stick figures are visible & known as â€œthe twins,â€ or the constellation Gemini.

Dundee Pale Bock Lager,1,6.25,"Certain things seem interminable. The line at the DMV. The commencement address. Winter. 

But take heart. Even the longest, darkest winter gives way to spring and a new sense of optimism that the best is just ahead. That thoughtâ€”and an itchy wool robeâ€”sustained the monks through times of fasting. Their reward? A bock beer with the power to rejuvenate the body and the soul. That, and the opportunity to exchange the wool robe for a nice burlap one. 

So when youâ€™re stuck in the middle of that seemingly endless glass of mediocre beer, be optimistic. A Dundee Pale Bock awaits.

A traditional German Maibock with a deep, golden color, malty-sweet aroma, and clean finish from Magnum and Czech Saaz hops."
Dundee Porter,1,6.5,"More and more weâ€™re becoming a nation of milquetoasts. And nowhere is that more evident than in our beerâ€”puny liquids without calories, carbs, or cojones. 

But it neednâ€™t be that way, my friend! Sure, we donâ€™t want to make a living shoveling coal or washing clothes on a rock. But we can recapture the more robust spirit of a time gone by.

Dundee Porter is a throwback to a different eraâ€”when times were tough and so were the people. They drank big beers, slapped each other on the back, and toasted the good lifeâ€”even though they only saw it from a distance. 

With Dundee Porter, you can get a taste of it.

Big and malty flavor from aromatic dark-roasted grains balanced by a subtle hint of hops. Deep color and rich caramel flavor."
Dundee Wheat Beer,1,4.2,"Senator Joseph McCarthy. The Hollow Earth Society. Members of the Spanish Inquisition. All convinced they were blessed with the gift of clarity. And proof that clarity might be overrated. 

Sometimes, being unclearâ€”and a little flexibleâ€”is a good thing. Like when you are looking for the perfect refreshment. Dundee Wheat Beer combines wheat and yeast into a refreshing hefeweizen-style brew. Unfiltered, so it is slightly cloudy and pleasantly unclear. 

So the next time youâ€™re convinced youâ€™re right about what youâ€™ve been drinking, give a little â€œunclarityâ€ a try.

An American-style, unfiltered wheat beer. Pale straw in color with a light cloudiness from carefully selected wheat and yeast. Pleasant spicy malt aroma and a crisp hop finish."
Dundee Pale Ale,1,5.3,"Behold the hop. A flower, but too unsightly to be used for decoration. The ugly duckling of the flower family. 

Oh, but the secret it holds. Soak it in some water with the right companions and it surrenders its bouquet to use a corny flower metaphor. That unique hop flavor is the difference between a fine pale ale and more ordinary beers. 

Dundee Pale Ale understands the secret of the hop flowerâ€”the power to turn an ordinary beer into something extraordinary. 

And the power to make you indescribably hoppy. 

A wonderfully balanced true pale ale. Cascade, Tomahawk, and Amarillo hops create a citrusy aroma with a smooth, crisp finish. A subdued malt character nicely complements the hop complexity and produces an orangey amber hue."
Dundee India Pale Ale,1,6.3,"It takes a bit of seasoning to understand that bitter can be a good thing. 

When youâ€™re a child, you want everything to be sweet. When youâ€™re a teenager, you want everything to be sweeeeet. But when you get a bit wiser and acquire some taste, you realize that bitter is an excellent alternative. Itâ€™s a sign of complexity. Itâ€™s a sign of maturity. Itâ€™s a sign of the times. Face it, modern life demands a little bitterness every once in a while. 

When you are in the mood for something bitter, Dundee IPA is hop bitterness at its finest. As the youngsters would say, thatâ€™s sweet.

An aggressively hopped IPA brewed with Amarillo and Simcoe hops. Blended Crystal malts balance the flavors with a distinctive spicy aroma and a long, crisp finish."
Dundee Festive Ale,1,6.2,"So did you ever ask yourself...what exactly is there to be festive about during the holidays? Your brother in-law snoring on the air mattress? (Boy, letâ€™s hope thatâ€™s snoring.) The variety of toys with realistic sound effects? Fruit cake?

Dundee Festive Ale may be one of the few exceptions. One sip of the carefully matched seasonal spices and you realize that the holidays are worth paying...waiting for.

Oh, there may be one other thing to be festive about. Thereâ€™s a 13 to 1 chance against your brother in-lawâ€™s plane leaving on time. But at least thereâ€™s a chance.

Festively hearty and full bodied with a mild nutmeg, allspice, cinnamon, and orange peel spice character and subtle crystal malt flavor."
Dynamo Copper Lager,1,5.6,"If malt and hops are the two poles of brewing, this beer is the gently spinning sweet spot between them. First, youâ€™ll notice the spicy aromas of Perle and Hallertau hops. Then - wipe the foam off the tip of your nose - dive into the toasty flavors of Vienna and Munich malts. Dynamo starts strong and finishes crisp and smooth. The balanced flavors, aromas, and even the coppery-red tones of this beer go great with everything. Fear no pairing. The best time to enjoy Dynamo is when youâ€™re thirsty.

Dynamo Copper Lager goes great with pizza, neighborhood block parties, spring rolls, first dates, football games, whiskey, tapas, the Sunday newspaper, late-night burritos, veggie omelets, business lunches, grilled mushrooms, pretzels, political debate, corn-on-the-cob, classic sci-fi flicks, mixed greens, campfires, salmon, billiards, cherry pie, rock shows, pumpernickel, salsa, grand openings, peanuts, sewing bees, extra sharp cheddar cheese, and holidays."
Flywheel Bright Lager,1,5,"The kinetic beauty of spicy hops grabs you by the nose and lets you know: this is German-inspired beer. A mild, bready malt sweetness greets you at the lips, smoothing the crisp hop flavors. Flywheel is meant for bombastic celebrations of singing voices and clamoring mugs. But then, that first contented moment of happy hour is uniquely celebratory as well.

Flywheel Bright Lager goes great with hot dogs, guitar jams, stir fry, bowling, taco salad, house warmings, baked potatoes, Saturday morning cartoons, tequila, gouda cheese, karaoke, bagel & schmear, Euchre, fresh berries, asparagus, 16-inch softball, sushi, darts, Pad Thai, family reunions, pb&j, flan, romantic weekend getaways, garlic bread, pay raises, nachos, baby showers, fondue, and Frisbee golf."
CD-Pils,1,4.9,
Saint Arnold Amber Ale,1,5.5,"A well balanced, full flavored, amber ale. It has a rich, malty body with a pleasant caramel character derived from a specialty Caravienne malt. A complex hop aroma, with a hint of floral and citrus comes from a combination of Cascades and Liberty hops. It has a rich, creamy head with a fine lace. The light fruitiness, characteristic of ales, is derived from a proprietary yeast strain. 

Saint Arnold Amber Ale is best consumed at 50 - 55Â° Fahrenheit."
Elissa IPA,1,6.6,"A traditional India Pale Ale, the Elissa IPA is very hoppy with a properly balanced malty body. Elissa has huge hop additions in the kettle that give it a wonderful bitterness and is then dry-hopped in the fermenter to create the pleasant floral, hoppy nose. Our reverse osmosis water makes the bitter very soft with no harsh notes to it. The maltiness is derived from British Maris Otter malt. Its rich flavor stands up to the hops that would otherwise dominate this beer. The Elissa is an authentic version of an India Pale Ale (IPA) style."
Saint Arnold Spring Bock,1,6.4,"An authentic, German-style Bock, celebrating the coming of spring. This strong, deeply flavored lager has been aged to create a smooth, malty taste with a hint of sweetness. A light addition of German hops balances the malt flavor. 

Saint Arnold Spring Bock is best consumed at 40Â° Fahrenheit."
Jasparilla,1,9,"Brilliantly golden, Jasperilla is a unique take on an old ale. Biscuity malt flavors meld with subtle plum and berry notes, produced by a special blend of English Old Ale and Chico yeasts. Brewed once a year, and aged for six months prior to release, the Jasperilla is smooth despite its 9% abv.
Jasper dressed as Hosehead from Strange Brew

We named this beer after our dog Jasper because he has brought so much joy to our lives. We got Jasper from a local dog rescue group called Mixed Breed Rescue. He has been a constant source of smiles and kept our spirits high through many late nights and long hours at the brewery.

Jasperilla is so good and smooth that you'll beg like a dog for more, roll over for a belly rub, howl at the moon...you get the picture."

We then gently age that beer in Elaigh Craig 13 1/2 year old Bourbon Barrels for 1 yr. and then primed and bottled to bottle condition for continued aging and celler life. Black Magick should be able to be aged up to about 5 years, to heighten the complexity and smooth nature of this beer. This beer should be opened to breath, pour into snifter and enjoy at 55-60 F. 

This is a truly Barrel aged ale and is not to have a large carbonation. We bottle condition it to achieve cask like characteristics."

Mildly hoppy and smooth with hints of chocolate and tons of brown malt to let you know it's there. Currently 7.3% by vol.

ABV is coming in around 7% on this one!"
Big Swell IPA,1,6.2,"India Pale Ale was developed in Burton, England, as a \Super-Premium\"" hoppy pale ale around 1800.

It definitely would not kill you to dig some up."
Back Road American Pale Ale,1,5,"If you are looking for a straight shooting quaffable beer with plenty of hops, this is it.  Straw colored from plump North American 2-row malted barley and deliciously hopped with Cascades from the USA, any patriot can enjoy this beer.  Cascade hops have a pleasant taste and fresh smell best described as florally or mildly citrusy.  A nice balance is struck between the malt and hops.  So how about it Yank?  Put that capitalism to work and buy some today!"
Midwest IPA,1,7.2,It means India Pale Ale.  It's all about the hops on this one.  Brewers use hops to add bitterness and aroma to their beers.  If not for hops your beer would be too sweet.  Our IPA uses plenty of Chinook and Columbus hops from the Pacific Northwest.  The flavor can best be described as strong resiny grapefruit.  The long drawn out hop flavor is essential to the character of the beer.  So smack your buds on this one all you HOP HEADS.
Millennium Lager,1,5,A classic pilsner.
Maple City Gold,1,7.2,"No, there is no maple flavor here, just a great beer with a good name.  LaPorte, Indiana is known as the \Maple City\"" because of its trees.  This German style Oktoberfest lager beer has a golden copper color and intense malty flavor.  We make this beer 4 times a year"

This beer demonstrates a unique balance of malt-inspired, delicate red grapefruit sweetness and lingering hop dryness. The OG and final ABV provide the structure and body to balance the harmony of distinct flavours.

This hop blend is well balanced with Malted Wheat, Pale Ale, Crystal, and Caramalt Malts. To fully enjoy all the flavours, this ale is best drunk at 55 degrees Fahrenheit. This beer pairs well with Cajun dishes, blackened fish, and BBQ. XXXX draws its name from the British brewing convention of using Xâ€™s to denote style. 70 BUâ€™s, 1.092 OG, 9.25% ABV."
Harpoon Winter Warmer,1,5.9,"Winter Warmer was Harpoonâ€™s first seasonal beer.  It was designed to be enjoyed during the holiday season. 

When you bring a glass of this dark copper ale to your lips to take your first sip you will notice the aroma of cinnamon.  There is no aromatic hop added that might overpower the distinct spice scent.  The medium body of this beer is formed from caramel and pale malts.  These create enough body to support the spices without making the beer excessively rich.  Bittering hops are added to counter the sweetness of the malt and spice.  The finish of the beer is a blend of cinnamon and nutmeg.  The combination of these two spices results in a balanced, pumpkin-pie flavor. 

The overall character is a smooth, medium bodied ale spiced with cinnamon and nutmeg"

Firestole Pale 31,1,4.6,One of the most award-winning American style pale ales in the country. This is the American beer style that started a revolution in taste.

A beer true to its origins; deeply hopped and bolstered for a long voyage."
Great Divide Belgica,1,7.2,"The Roman name for the Low Countriesâ€“is a marriage of the best in American and Belgian brewing traditions. Belgian pilsner malt, a generous amount of American and European hops and a unique Belgian yeast strain combine to give Belgica big notes of citrus and spice, creating a lively concoction perfect for spring in the Rockiesâ€“or the Ardennes."
Great Divide Dunkel Weiss,1,6.4,"Think of it as a hefeweizenâ€™s older brother. A hearty mix of wheat and dark German barley malts gives it a medium body and muddy brown hue, while our proprietary yeast strain provides the signature notes of banana and clove. If you like wheat beers, come to the Dunkel side. You wonâ€™t be disappointed. Just donâ€™t put any lemon in it."
Great Divide Saison,1,7.3,"Our homage to the beers that have quenched the thirst of Belgian farm workers for centuries. Brewed with barley, wheat and rice and fermented at high temperatures with a special blend of four different yeast strains, Saison is fruity and slightly tart, with a dry finish that makes it that rarest of treatsâ€“a beer as refreshing as it is complex."

tropical flavors, some banana, a hint of clove."
Flashback Anniversary Ale,1,6.8,"Flashback Anniversary Ale is an India-Brown Ale with 6.8% ABV. This is the first beer weâ€™ve made here that uses one single hop variety (Cascade) in the recipe in five separate additions. The fresh Cascade hop aroma and flavor is perfectly balanced with the dark roasted grains, making Flashback a very unique beer. Weâ€™re calling it an India Brown Ale to help illustrate its flavor to the consumer. Itâ€™s hoppy like an IPA but dark and roasty like a Brown Ale. Put them together and voila! Flashback at its finest!"

Duck-Rabbit Brown Ale,1,5.6,The Duck-Rabbit Brown Ale is an American brown ale brewed with loads of hops from start to finish (itâ€™s hoppy and beautifully bitter).

Oh yeah!
Duck-Rabbit Porter,1,5.7,"The Duck-Rabbit Porter is very dark in color. This robust porter features a pronounced flavor of roasted grains reminiscent of dark chocolate. Also, Paul and Brandon add oats to the grist to give a subtle round silkiness to the mouthfeel. Weâ€™re confident that youâ€™re really going to love this yummy porter!"
Duck-Rabbit Milk Stout,1,5.7,The Duck-Rabbit Milk Stout is a traditional full-bodied stout brewed with lactose (milk sugar). The subtle sweetness imparted by the lactose balances the sharpness of the highly roasted grains which give this delicious beer its black color.
Back Burner Imperial Barley Wine Style Ale,1,10,"Long ago, British farmhouse brewers made special ales using the first runnings of the mash. These beers, now called barley wine, are brewed in the tradition of days past. At Southern Tier this long awaited brew is placed on the back burner until the start of the new year. Back Burner Barley Wine is a celebration of things to come and things remembered. Itâ€™s conceived in three small batches, using voluminous amounts of barley and hops. The process starts early in the morning and ends late into the night. We hope this rare brew reignites your spirit for another trip around the sun."
Ãœber Sun Imperial Summer Wheat Ale,1,8,"It is through the movement of the universe that life presents itself in transformation. It is in this spirit that we make ÃœberSun, a tribute to the dynamic energy of summer. The alignment of wheat and barley through this hop-infused brew embodies the solar system itself... This may be a difficult task, but one our brewers revel in! They brew a galaxy of taste into every batch. ÃœberSun is the ultimate experience that will challenge you with each sip. ÃœberSun Imperial Summer Wheat Beer takes off where our Hop Sun finishes. Like itâ€™s little brother, ÃœberSun is clean and full of flavor, but donâ€™t pull an Icarusâ€“ this is one big beer!

Preserved in its unfiltered state, 422 is a fantastic session ale in which flavors of wheat, barley and hops commingle to a refreshing and zesty conclusion. Hints of orange and sweet malts waft to the fore as a touch of bitterness contributes to a smooth finish. 422 is brewed as a tribute to preserving our precious planet and itâ€™s environment. It is responsibly packaged with over 80% recycled consumer products and is completely recyclable. Enjoy 422 all year as to take one stride closer to a eco-friendly life."

Sea Dog Raspberry Wheat Ale,1,4.5,"Sea Dog Raspberry Wheat Ale is a dry, crisp refreshing ale with the added essence of raspberries."
Wacko,1,4.5,This beer truly defies style. A portion of the fermentable sugars that make up this beer come from beet sugar. Real beet extract is used which gives the beer a beautiful light red color. Itâ€™s body is inviting and the taste is smooth. Hops are barely perceivable and are there to balance out the sweetness from the malt.
Black Ops,1,11,"Brooklyn Black Ops does not exist. However, if it did exist, it would be a robust stout concocted by the Brooklyn brewing team under cover of secrecy and hidden from everyone else at the brewery. Supposedly â€œBlack opsâ€ was aged for four months in bourbon barrels, bottled flat, and re-fermented with Champagne yeast, creating big chocolate and coffee flavors with a rich underpinning of vanilla-like oat notes. They say there are only 1,000 cases. We have no idea what theyâ€™re talking about."
Fuller's ESB,1,4.5,"ESB was launched into the Fuller's family in 1971, as a winter brew to replace a beer named Old Burton Extra. The potential of the beer was soon realised and ESB was installed as a permanent fixture, creating an immediate impact. 

Not only was it one of the strongest regularly brewed draught beers in the country (at 5.5% ABV), it was also one of the tastiest, and as the awareness of the beer grew, so did its popularity. ESB's reputation was soon enhanced after being named CAMRA's (Campaign for Real Ale) Beer of the Year in 1978, and the beer has not stopped winning since! 

With three CAMRA Beer of the Year awards, two World Champion Beer awards, and numerous other gold medals to speak of, ESB is, quite simply, the Champion Ale."
Schlafly Oktoberfest,1,5.1,"A malty, full-bodied, deep reddish-amber lager. Traditionally brewed in March for the Oktoberfest in the fall, this style is also known as MÃ¤rzen. Also available in bottles."
Standing Stone Lager,1,0,"A dry, crisp refreshing filtered lager.  A good balance between sweet malt and light bitter hops.  This beer is made with a Southern German lager yeast, Saaz, and Hershbrucker hops."

Bhagwan's Best IPA,1,5,"Building on a classic English style and adding some uniquely Northwest touches, Bhagwan's Best has developed fiercely loyal following wherever it is served.  Bursting with local hop flavor, bitterness, and aroma, it is a particular treat when served dry-hopped and cask-conditioned on Big Time's beer engine. O.G. 16 Plato (1.064), alcohol is approximately 5% by weight."
Summer Blonde,1,4,"Great summer memories are born out of uncomplicated times. We've made that the basis for our summer blonde recipe and kept this ale pure and simple. Relax and enjoy this all natural, light, golden beauty; a seasonal offering from the River Horse Brewing Company."
River Horse Lager,1,5,"We mill the choicest two row barley malt in our 100 year old mill room for this all natural, unfiltered Lager. Lightly hopped, fermented slowly. River Horse Lager gets plenty of quality time with us before we pass it on to you."
Hop Hazard,1,5.5,"Brewing the perfect ale is truly a balancing act...hazardous work you might say. With Hop Hazard our challenge was to hand craft a malt rich base that could counterbalance a combustible five-hop blend and still leave your taste buds with enough room to enjoy a unique, crisp hop finish."
Belgian Freeze Winter Ale,1,8,"As the days grow shorter and frost becomes snow, our Belgian Freeze winter ale is the perfect remedy to loosen the spirits. This deep amber tonic is brewed with lots of roasted caramel malt for body and warmth to bring in the holidays and see you through the spring."
Tripel Horse,1,10,"Notice a unique aromatic nose with a hint of vanilla esters, which comes from the Belgian ale yeast. Tripel Horse has a big body and rich mouth feel and finishes mostly dry with only a touch of sweetness. If you shy from some of the sweeter Belgian ales, we think you will enjoy this one. The palate improves with age, so keep some on hand and you can ride Tripel Horse down a new path with each opened bottle."
River Horse Special Ale,1,4.5,It's been with us from the start and hasn't changed since that first brew way back in 1996. Ample quantities of caramel malt give this English ale a soft copper hue and the colorful addition of carapils malt adds a slight sweetness you might mistake for honey.
Orchard White,1,5.7,"Orchard White is an unfiltered, bottle conditioned Belgian-style witbier. This hazy, straw yellow beer is spiced with coriander, citrus peel and lavender added to the boil and whirlpool. A spicy, fruity yeast strain is used to add complexity, and rolled oats are added for a silky texture."
Black Orchard,1,5.7,"Black Orchard is an unfiltered, bottle conditioned Belgian-style black wheat beer, or â€œblack witâ€, if you will. This dark but surprisingly light bodied beer is very drinkable while still having character and complexity. Chamomile is added for its floral aroma, while the coriander and citrus peel give the characteristics of a traditional witbier."
Saison Rue,1,8.5,"Saison Rue is an unfiltered, bottle conditioned, Belgian/French-style farmhouse ale. This is a beer of subtlety and complexity, with malted rye, spicy, fruity yeast notes, biscuit-like malt backbone, and a slight citrus hop character. With age, this beer will dry out and will become more complex with rustic notes of leather and earth from the contribution of a wild yeast strain. Being a Saison, Saison Rue is ambiguous unto itself as it is a different beer when fresh and when aged. We hope you enjoy it in all of its incarnations."
Saison De Lente,1,6.5,"Our Spring Saison is light blonde in color with a fresh hoppiness and a wild and rustic Brettanomyces character. Lighter in color and alcohol than our Saison Rue, yet equally complex in its own way. Perfect for warmer weather and Spring celebrations."
Trade Winds Tripel,1,8,"Our Summer seasonal, Trade Winds Tripel is a Belgian-style Golden Ale with a Southeast Asian twist. Instead of using candi sugar (typical for such a beer), we use rice in the mash to lighten the body and increase the gravity, and spice with Thai Basil. The result is an aromatic, digestible and complex beer made for a lazy summer evening."
Autumn Maple,1,10,"Brewed with 17 lbs. of yams per barrel (in other words, a lot of yams!), this autumn seasonal is a different take on the â€œpumpkinâ€ beer style. Brewed with cinnamon, nutmeg, allspice, vanilla, molasses, and maple syrup, and fermented with our traditional Belgian yeast strain, this bold and spicy beer is perfect on a cold autumn evening."
Partridge In A Pear Tree,1,12,"Our holiday beer is a Belgian-style Dark Strong Ale, brewed with our brewery-made dark candi sugar, Munich and Vienna malts. Dark brown in color, fruity and complex with a rich malt backbone. This is a simple yet immensely complex beer meant to be savored and shared with friends and family."
Scratch #19 2009 Imperial Double Expresso Oatmeal Stout,1,9.5,"Every beer tells a story, and some are longer than others.

Consider Scratch #19; originally designed as an enhanced take on Scratch #15 with a slightly higher ABV, our brewers went to town to deliver a brew slightly more akin to our fabled Scratch #5, the Imperial Oatmeal Stout brewed for The Flying Mouflan Experience.

For Scratch #19, we teamed up with St. Thomas Roasters of Linglestown to create a special blend of espresso beans. They added Kenyan beans to the mix because of a strong citrus flavor that compliments the hops. Creating en environment akin a French press, the beans are combined with whole flower hops in the hopback, and the hot wort passes through the vessel on the way to fermentation giving Scratch #19 a lush coffee espresso nose and hints of coffee flavor. There is a silky quality to the mouthfeel and a citrus hop finsh coming from the Kenyan beans and hops.

Some stories have twists, and unfortunately a faulty valve in the fermentation cellar led to a dramatic beer tragedy one afternoon in the brewery. Risking life and limb (while keeping his mouth open to sample the beer), a heroic brewery team member took the dive reconnecting the valve and saving about half the batch of Scratch #19.

So for your amusement (and our final relief), we give you a draft-only release of a third-take on a style that demands continued research for the Troegs Brewery staff. Enjoy!"
Newport Storm Hurricane Amber Ale,1,5.2,"The first offering from the Coastal Extreme Brewing Company blends some of the world's finest ingredients into a delightful beer. In producing our amber ale, we selected the highest quality European and American malts and hops. This ale has a malt character which is delicately balanced with its hop profile so that consumers of all levels enjoy drinking it. Hurricane Amber Ale is a full flavored beer which clearly has more taste than other domestic and imported light beers while at the same time does not overpower the drinker with heavy body or excessive bitterness. So find yourself a cold 'Hurricane' and ENJOY!"
Meantime Coffee,1,6,"Whilst we wouldnâ€™t recommend having this at breakfast with your bacon and eggs, our Coffee Beer is made with real coffee and has a caffeine hit to match. The natural flavours of the beans selected and hand roasted by our friends at the Union Coffee Roasters go well with the roast barley in the beer to give a silky-smooth drink with distinct chocolate and vanilla notes. 

Our first formulation of this beer was the first UK brewed beer to carry the Fairtrade logo, and, although we have reformulated it to create an even better blend of malt and roast coffee flavours, we can no longer get enough coffee in each bottle to qualify for Fairtrade status. However we are still using the same Faitrade Araba Bourbon beans from Rwandaâ€™s Abuhuzamugambi Bakawa Co-operative.

At the Meantime Brewing Co we love flavour, so it wasnâ€™t exactly difficult for us to see how the scents and aromas of coffee and barley would create a perfect match like just like mint and lamb, toffee and banana, peaches and cream, peanut butter and jam. Serve lightly chilled with as many chocolate truffles as your conscience allows.

Each serving is equal to one cup of coffee"

Dortmund is an industrial, steel-making town and its lagers are hearty, easy drinking brewskies. The hops balance the malt but not overtly so. A great brew for the end of a hard day at work.

Big Dick's Olde Ale,1,8.2,"Somewhat of a cousin to Barleywine, Big Dickâ€™s is a classic English-style Olde Ale.  Sweet and full-bodied malt flavors are complemented by a fragrant but mild hop bitterness.  Sweet, bready malt aromas combine with rich flavors of dark fruit, brown sugar, caramel, and sweet nuts. A beer for keeping, Big Dickâ€™s Olde Ale will age gracefully, while fruity flavors continue to develop and bitterness will subside.

This is not only a BIG beer, it is a Well-Endowed Ale!  We took a traditional English-style Ale and made it our own.  Delightful on its own or as a digestif with a full-bodied cigar, Big Dickâ€™s is also big enough to stand up to many boldly-flavored foods."

Old Oak Amber Ale,1,0,A well balanced American Amber Ale. Smooth malt character balanced with a healthy dose of Cascade hops aged on oak chips - our most popular beer.
Lightner Creek Lager,1,0,"A light bodied golden ale, low in hop character with a spicy aroma from whole Czech Saaz hops."
Iron Horse Oatmeal Stout,1,0,"One of these beers is available all of the time. Our heartiest beers emphasize roasted malts and the generous use of hops. Creamy, smooth and always nitrogenated, these beers are nearly a meal or a dessert in themselves."
Colorado Trail Nut Brown Ale,1,0,The slightly roasted flavor and nutty palate with a hint of hops make this beer subtle and drinkable.
Exodus Porter,1,0,"This is a classic American Porter, poured on tap it has a good head that stays and leaves a nice lace.  It is defined by its chocolate malt, medium body, and smooth mouthfeel.  Balanced by the Golding and Columbus hops on the finish is a hint of bitterness.  
Donâ€™t be afraid of the dark."
Sante Fe Pale Ale,1,5.5,"Anything but a typical American Pale, Santa Fe Pale Ale is as full bodied as its most robust English counterparts, while asserting its American origin with a healthy nose resplendent with Cascade and Willamette hops. It finishes with a well-balanced combination of the subtle, almost Pilsner-like maltiness accentuated by the German yeast used to brew this Santa Fe classic, and a hop bite sufficient to leave a lingering smile on the face of any fan of American Pale Ales."
Santa Fe Wheat,1,5.25,"A true Bavarian wheat yeast, sixty percent wheat malt, and German hops make Santa Fe Wheat Beer as true to the style as any American rendition can be. German Wheat Beer, with its hints of banana and clove, its delectable, spicy, hops, and its pale golden color, is becoming increasingly popular in Americaâ€™s craft brewing world, and with good reason: wheat beers are both light enough to please light beer drinkers, and complex enough to please true micro-brew connoisseurs. To mimic a classic German Hefeweisen, after pouring your Santa Fe Wheat Beer into a glass, swirl the last few drops in the bottle to loosen the yeast from the bottom, then pour the yeast over the top of your beer."
Santa Fe Nut Brown,1,5.2,"The Brown Ale style originated in the pubs of England, where beer drinkers desired a beer that was both flavorful and complex, but at the same time mild enough to be a session beer. The Santa Fe Brewing Company's interpretation of this style uses a combination of high mash temperature, hard water, and low-alpha acid hops to produce a product that is both true to the style and distinctly Santa Fe. Brewing jargon aside, Santa Fe Nut Brown Ale is an easy-drinking beer, mild, smooth, and always a favorite. Try a keg at your next party!"
State Pen Porter,1,6.4,"A trademark beer of the Santa Fe Brewing Companyâ€™s master brewer, Ty Levis, the State Pen Porter has every reason to be one of his favorites. It is flavorful, swimming with notes of nuts and chocolate; it is drinkable, so drinkable that it is almost as if pint after pint were drinking itself."
Santa Fe Stout,1,5,"A hearty sip of the Santa Fe Stout delights oneâ€™s taste buds first with a generous Irish serving of roast malt that rolls off the tongue with a creamy bitterness reminiscent of the finest coffee. Supported by the complex, yet light body only possible with a good Irish yeast strain, this coffee-like creaminess eventually yields to the warmth of a subtle variety of hops, and their mild, full flavor. A favorite with regular customers, this rare brew can occasionally be found on draft at restaurants in Santa Fe, but is more likely on tap at the Brewery's tasting room. Despite its intimidating dark color, this brew has an uncanny ability to convert those who claim not to like beer. The balance of flavors and complexity of aroma are recognized and appreciated by all who taste this fine brew."
Chicken Killer Barley Wine,1,10,"Chicken Killer Barley Wine is the revolutionary beer that will someday define America's unique Barley Wine style. It is brewed with twice the ingredients of the Santa Fe Brewing Company's other beers, and only half the usual amount of liquid is extracted from these ingredients. This makes one substantial beer. At over ten percent alcohol, Chicken Killer is actually as substantial as wine, but this is not to say that it is difficult to drink. On the contrary; be careful with this one. The flavors of the beer are at first as overwhelming as the intense Santa Fe sun. But in the same way our sun gives us the unrivaled brilliant colors of Santa Fe, the potency of Chicken Killer gives us the remarkable spectrum of flavors that can be found in no other beer, in no other city. If you did not have the opportunity to try last year's vintage, come try this year's!"
Fiesta IPA,1,6.3,"A classic beer for those beer lovers who love their hops, Fiesta IPA will take the Pepsi Challenge (or IPA challenge, as we say in New Mexico) against any other pretenders to the throne. Was it divine providence that made this beer the king of the IPA world? Was it a tireless pursuit of glory? No, this IPA has a top-secret recipe to thank for its success, and this meticulously formulated combination of several different hops combined with a very specific brewing process give Fiesta IPA a spicy, citric, and floral infusion of hop character, which is masterfully counterbalanced with the full-bodied maltiness characteristic of the Santa Fe Brewing Companyâ€™s distinctive beers."
Freestyle Pilsner,1,5.5,"As its name suggests, this Pilsner does not like to be categorized. Inquiring whether it is a German, Czech, Bavarian, American, or any other style pilsner will result in an impatient sigh and the explanation that the whole philosophy behind this pilsner is that it does not fall into any categories. True, it is brewed with traditional ingredients (soft water, pilsner malt, saaz hops, and German yeast), but it is the way that these ingredients interact, and the characteristics of the yeast, that cause this particular pilsner to defiantly stand alone. The assertively hopped Freestyle pils exudes the flavor and the aroma of the classic Saaz hop (a tribute to â€œthe originalâ€ pilsner), while maintaining enough body to balance but not overpower this hopâ€™s pleasant, spicy tone. An unhurried lagering process so frequently overlooked by American craft brewers is strictly adhered to in the production of Freestyle, which makes this beer by far the most light, clean, and quenching beer in the Santa Fe Brewing Companyâ€™s line up."
Viszolay Belgian,1,7.5,"Viszolay is a distinctly continental ale with a hint of the southwest. Belgian malt, Bavarian and Czech hops, and a secret blend of German and Belgian yeast strains provide this beer, inspired by the Trappistâ€™s Dubbel style ale, with a strong traditional base, while a hint of New Mexico wildflower honey infuses it with that ethereal quality that we New Mexicans simply call, â€œenchantingâ€. Like the Trappist ales from which it sprung, Viszolay is light and refreshing. The hopâ€™s subtle notes are overpowered by complex fruity flavors derived from the Belgian yeast, leaving Viszolay a very drinkable (yet rather potent) addition to the Santa Fe Brewing Companyâ€™s family of beers."
Stiegl GoldbrÃ¤u,1,4.9,"This wonderfully refreshing beer specialty from Stiegl, Austriaâ€™s largest privately owned brewery is brewed in strict adherence with the 1516 purity law of only using water, malt and hops. Stiegl-GoldbrÃ¤u is an Austrian styled beer with its own distinctive Salzburg lager flavor. The 12o original gravity is unparalleled in its even taste and ability to refresh. It is mildly hopped is golden in color has a great head with a superb finish. Stiegl-GoldbrÃ¤u is considered by many connoisseurs to be the worldâ€™s finest beer."
Weizengold Dunkel,1,0,"Stiegl Weizengold. It has 12o original gravity; the choicest ingredients and a top fermentation process are responsible for the highest possible quality and an unmistakable flavor. It is brewed according to the classic wheat beer recipe: 60 % wheat malt and 40 % barley malt, top fermentation and in compliance with the Purity Law of 1516.  This dark wheat beer specialty is a natural and spicy beer brand."
Stiegl Leicht,1,3.3,This is a light beer with a full taste and a third less alcohol so therefore 30% less calories. It is ideal for beer lovers who prefer light beers but do not want to renounce the taste.
Paracelsus Zwickl,1,5,"Paracelsus Zwickl is a natural beer specialty with a mellow impression on the tongue. The aftertaste unfolds a slight bitterness. Zwickl-beer is not filtered and therefore shows some cloudiness due to rests of yeast, minerals and trace elements.

This very special beer is brewing at its best using a sophisticated recipe combined with love and dedication. Stiegl only uses excellent ingredients from Austrian agricultural suppliers, applying biological techniques. As a result of this Paracelsus Zwickl beer was awarded the Bio-Austria certificate. Bio-production is subject to strict yearly controls by â€œAustria-Bio-Guarantyâ€.

â€œBier is a really divine medicineâ€. This quotation comes from Paracelsus (1493 â€“ 1541). He was a well known physician, forward thinker and visionary who lived in Salzburg for many years. He found out that beer had healing powers."

Cafe Amsterdam's 10th Anniversary Gruit,1,12,"SPECIAL COMMEMORATIVE BEER

Former brewer Ken Pajak teamed up with MSBC to create a very special beer to celebrate the 10 years that he and wife Shauna have owned CafÃ© Amsterdam. Since taking over this mid-town establishment, the Pajaks added a â€œbeer & wine licenseâ€ and subsequently transformed the European-style cafÃ© into a beer-centric place to grab breakfast, lunch, dinner and all beers during, around and between these fabulous meals. 

The cafe's beer menu is extensive and all-encompassing. The staff is knowledgeable and enthusiastic. And the beer pour is always rightâ€” temperature, glass, presentation. 

â€œNo hops were harmed in the brewing of this beer.â€ 

Gruit is an old styleâ€”one that incorporates spices, herbs and fruit but no hops. The latter detail makes this style very rare in modern times. CafÃ© Amsterdamâ€™s Gruit is dark, strong and interesting. This combination of pale and dark malts, sage, thyme, cinnamon, black peppercorn and fresh orange peel composes distinctive, substantial flavors that meld together wonderfully. And at 12% ABV, this cellar-friendly ale is ready to lay you down! Thoroughly enjoy this old-world beer now but stash some away for later dwelvings.

Founded in 1992, the Mart continues to be a catalyst for the San Diego brewing scene, setting the trend for handcrafted ales. Inspired by our customers, employees and brewers, the Sculpin IPA is bright with aromas of apricot, peach, mango and lemon. Its lighter body also brings out the crispness of the hops. This delicious Ballast Point Ale took a Bronze Medal at the 2007 Great American Beer Festival in the Pro Am category. The Sculpin fish has poisonous spikes on its fins that can give a strong sting. Ironically, the meat from a Sculpin is considered some of the most tasty. Something that has a sting but tastes great, sounds like a Ballast Point India Pale Ale."

This beer originated as a prize-winning homebrew many years ago. When Darron, the Head Brewer, began designing the beers for the Pelican Pub and Brewery, he adapted his old 5 gallon homebrew recipe to his new 15 bbl (465 gallon) brewery. It was well worth the effort, for not only has the Doryman's Dark Ale been a perennial favorite here at the Pelican Pub, but it has garnered prestigious professional awards."

T- It tastes a tad like Bass with a hint of coffee to it. At least to me it had a coffee taste. It's got a nice even taste. It's not too strong and not too weak. It's a happy medium.

M-It feels good when swallowing. It leaves a mild aftertaste but it's a good aftertaste.

D-Well I drank the whole jug w/ no problem and enjoyed myself so that spoke for itself.

Overall, I recommend this beer. If you find it, it's worth having. It goes well when watching a movie too.

Abita Satsuma Harvest Wit is very versatile and can compliment a number of dishes. This brew pairs well with salads, fish, shrimp and lobster, as long as the dishes are not too spicy. Thai dishes, which often have citric notes in their flavor profile, would also perfectly compliment the orange flavors in Abita Satsuma Harvest Wit."

Scratch #20 2009 Apollo Imperial Ale,1,7,"Scratch #20 has been dubbed Apollo Imperial Ale because of our experimentation with a new hop variety.
 
Apollo hops are high alpha acid with an intense aroma. Married with other high alpha hops, with almost two pounds of hops added per barrel produced, AIA has an intense staying power in the back of the throat. After a long discussion between Chris, John and the brewers, they dubbed this hop flavor stinky grapefruit with a hint of perfume. The dark color might lead you to believe the some malt may shine through; but no, the hops are the true player in this ale.
 
Scratch #20 has a dual role, also serving at The Drafting Roomâ€™s Anniversary Ale for 2009. We brewed a bit more to serve the brewery and The Drafting Room, but get it while when you see it. Before this intense hop flavor subsides, this beer will be sold out."

This amber beer was brewed in March (\Marzenbier\"") and left to age in cool lagering caves during the heat of the summer.

Which is why we created the perfect session beer â€“ the Terrapin Golden Ale."
13th Anniversary Ale,1,9.5,"Stone 13th Anniversary Ale pours brilliant deep red with a light tan foam. Up front, the aroma is all piney, resinous and citrus hops.

Oak Barrel Stout,1,5.2,Dominion Oak Barrel Stout raises the bar for American stouts. We use smoked and peated malts to create an intricate malt foundation.  Willamette and Cascade hops balance the malt character and our method of dry hopping with vanilla beans and oak chips pushes the depth of our stout's flavor spectrum even further.
Drie Fonteinen Kriek,1,5,
Elm City Schwarzbier,1,5.3,
Ramstein Winter Wheat,1,9.5,"Also referred to as a Doppelbock, this is the strongest beer made by High Point. Rich creamy head with bouquet of wheat malt, black current, clove, and apple. Deep full flavors of caramel and chocolate malt balance with hops for a smooth warming character. The finish is smooth and malty leading to a subtle alcohol and dark caramel finish.

Scratch #21 2009 - Artisan Ale,1,7.8,"Scratch #21-2009 is an exercise in deconstruction and minimalism. This Belgian Ale has distinct roots in The Mad Elf minus some key components.
 
The cherries? Gone.
The honey? Gone.
The chocolate malt? Gone.

Wait, this sounds familiar. It almost sounds like a naked version of The Mad Elf.
 
Coming in just under 8% ABV, this unfiltered golden beauty shows off the pronounced yeast flavor that made The Mad Elf famous as well as a touch of alcohol and some mellow malt flavors."
Java Head Stout,1,7.5,"We teamed up with St. Thomas Roasters of Linglestown, PA to create a special blend of espresso beans. They added Kenyan beans to the mix because of a strong citrus flavor that compliments the hops. Creating an environment akin a French press, the beans are combined with whole flower hops in the hopback, and the hot wort passes through the vessel on the way to fermentation giving Java Head a lush coffee espresso nose and hints of coffee flavor. There is a silky quality to the mouthfeel and a citrus aromas from the combination of Kenyan beans and whole flower hops."
Scratch #22 2009,1,5.5,
Otter Creek Imperial India Pale Ale,1,11,"Originally brewed for thirsty British troops stationed on the subcontinent of India, India Pale Ales had to withstand the sea voyage around Africa. Brewers need to take full advantage of two preservatives at the time: hops and alcohol. They increased their hopping rates, doubled  their malt useage to increase alcohol content, and dry-hopped the brew before it set out on its voyage.
Our Imperial IPA carries on this tradition- and then some!  The fruity and citrusy hop aroma intermingles perfectly with an assertive malty backbone.  Our brewers added a generous supply of hops to this brew throughout the entire process to provide an enormous hop flavor and balance the elevated alcohol content.

This beer is 11% alcohol by volume, and 135 IBU!"

Derailed Black Cherry Ale,1,5,"Brewery folklore tells a story about a train engineer with a passion for the taste of Railbender Ale. With every stop he made in Erie came an equal number of stops at our brewery. One extended visit to our fermenter left the engineer in a rather befuddled state of mind. On his fateful trip out of Erie that evening, his train mysteriously derailed. The engineer swears that a huge black cherry tree had fallen across the tracks as the culprit. No such tree was ever found, but the front of the locomotive was spattered with hundreds of red sports. In tribute to this folklore our expert brewers introduce Derailed Black Cherry Ale â€“ brewed with fresh sweet black cherries and the finest malted barley to create a truly cherrylicious ale. Please enjoy responsibly, as we would never want you to get derailed!"
Heavy Seas Big DIPA,1,10.6,"Big DIPA â€“ Double IPA,  is the first in the Heavy Seas Special Edition Series due to be released in mid June.  Hopped 3 times in the brewing process, Big DIPA has an earthy hop aroma.  In keeping with the Heavy Seas philosophy we've made a big beer with a surprising balance.

Andygator,1,8,"The Andygator is a fearsome beast...much too big for any little bottle. Don't let his toothy grin, slightly sweet flavor and subtle fruit aroma fool you: this cold-blooded creature is a Helles Doppelbock that can sneak up on you. Sip, don't gulp and taste the wild of Abita Andygator"
Red Chair IPA,1,6.4,"Red Chair IPA is named after the oldest operating lift at Mt. Bachelor, a classic old school double that locals flock to on fresh powder mornings. This beer has been wildly popular with our pub regulars, who always seem to know when we have hit on something special. 

This IPA is a bright copper beauty with a solid head and perfect lacing that typifies Deschutes ales. It has a plush body with satiny caramel flavors derived from seven varieties of malt. Despite all of this, Red Chair is still a hop forward ale, but not in the way many have gotten used to. You will find no cloying, mouth puckering bitterness here. In its place a straight up succulent citrus punch to the nose."
Cattail Peak,1,4.7,"An invigorating wheat beer with 100% organic grains, a hint of rye and the tang and hue of organic hibiscus, this refreshing brew is as cool as the breeze that blows down from Mount Mitchell to Cattail Peak.

Karma,1,5.2,
Black Butte XXI,1,11,"It usually means bigger. Richer. And we can think of no better way to describe the taste of this even-bolder take on our classic, Black Butte Porter.

On the flavor scale - Itâ€™s legendary."

Imperial Premium Malt Pilsner,1,8.8,"Lion Imperial Lager, from Sri Lanka, is brewed using the finest natural ingredients - delivering a rich smooth taste and refreshment. Enjoy its bite."
Rock Art IPA,1,0,"A light copper body low bitterness with good hop flavor. This is my impression of what the English troops may have been drinking when they occupied India. The pale ale they drank had mellowed considerably. The wooden casks had spent many months traveling on ships and long inland journeys to the troops, where they were then tapped and enjoyed."
Gouden Carolus Hopsinjoor,1,8,"Gouden Carolus Hopsinjoor completes the taste pallet of the gamma Carolus-beers.  

\Hopsinjoor\"" is a wordplay to for one thing the several hops which were used"
Black Rye Bock,1,6.2,This dark lager combines the characteristics of three winter beer styles. All three of these styles traditionally come from the colder harsher areas of Europe. The styles are (1) Black Beer (aka schwartzbier) originating from the former East Germany); (2) Rye Beer which at one time was only made in hardier areas of Eastern and Baltic Europe; and (3) Bock Beer which is widely known as a higher alcohol lager of Northern Germany. Our Black Rye Bock has a distinctive bitter chocolate palate and black color reminiscent of a black beer. The spiciness from the rye malt shines through in the flavor. The high alcohol balanced with malty sweetness rounds out this cold season bock. Smooth drinking with a punch makes this lager a perfect quaffer for our Arctic winter. 6.2% alcohol by volume.
Blackened Voodoo,1,5,"Inspired by old-world brewing methods, this bewitching all-malt brew is a darkly rich, exotic lager, crafted with a touch of magical New Orleans spirit."

This creamy, deeply delicious milk stout will seduce you into submission while the explosion of hand roasted gourmet espresso will blow you into next week. We Shall Drink in the breweries. We Shall Drink in the pubs, We Shall Drink the the comfort of our homes. We Shall Never Surrender."
Mythos Hellenic Lager,1,5,
Red Brick Double Chocolate Oatmeal Porter,1,7.7,A robust porter brewed with lots of chocolate malt and roasted barley. This gives the beer its nearly black color and coffee and dark chocolate flavors. These flavors are then tempered with the use of flaked oats which provide an almost creamy texture to the beer. The 7.7% abv is deceptive but is not completely unnoticed.
Georgi-Belgique,1,6.4,
Tarletons Bitters,1,0,
Duck-Rabbit Schwarzbier,1,5.8,
Smuttynose Pumpkin Ale,1,5.1,"Smuttynose Pumpkin Ale is our homage to the craft and heritage of Americaâ€™s brewers. Recipes calling for the use of pumpkins in beer date back to early colonial times, when brewers sought to extend their supply of costly imported malt with locally grown ingredients, such as squash and â€œpompions.â€

In that spirit, we brew our ale with the addition of pumpkin to the mash, along with traditional spices to create a delicious American original."
Big Slick American Barleywine Ale,1,11.9,"This kick ass American Barley Wine is all about hops â€”Nugget, Chinook, Simcoe and Centennial. And, yeah, LoTs of â€˜em. OKâ€¦thereâ€™s a substantial malt base on which these juicy Pacific NW hops lie down and do their dirty work. Maybe thatâ€™s too much infoâ€¦"
Otter Creek Russian Imperial Stout,1,10.6,"The style was first brewed in England for the Russian Czar and it is the king of stouts. Plenty of big malt flavors- chocolate and roasted- and high alcohol with lower carbonation and mild hops. 
We brewed this beer with double the malts and four times the hops of regular stouts!

Otter Creek Russian Imperial Stout clocks in around 10% ABV- a beer to be savored responsibly. True to style, this beer will last for years so you may want to stock up on a few bottles for your cellar while it's available.

Presents a light hazy yellow colour with citrus and coriander aromas and fairly subtle malt and hops on the palate. The finish is dry and satisfying. Hazy yellow golden colour. Lemon custard, lime zest, and delicate spice melange aromas. Well-balanced, a frothy entry leads to a dryish medium body of nuts, baked oranges, and slightly phenolic mineral flavors. Finishes with a metallic ore dust, salt, and dried lemon fade. This beer is certified as organic."

Wild Goose Pumpkin Patch,1,6,"Our Fall Seasonal, Pumpkin Patch Ale, is the perfect beer for an autumn night. Pumpkin Patch pours a hazy orange with frothy, ivory colored head. The nose immediately conjures images of Grandma baking pumpkin pie with notes of nutmeg, cinnamon and ginger.

3767 Belgian-style IPA with Brett,1,8,"The extensive distance between two breweries on the West Coast â€“ 3767 miles â€“ is bridged by this collaboration beer. Brewers Gabe Fletcher of Midnight Sun Brewing Company [Anchorage, AK] and Colby Chandler of Ballast Point Brewing Company [San Diego, CA] designed and brewed an exciting representation of their passions: hops, Belgian yeast, oak aging and Brettanomyces. 

Just prior to the Great Alaska Beer & Barley Wine Fest in JAN 2009, Gabe and Colby brewed a West Coast-worthy IPA at Midnight Sun Brewing Company. This hop-centric beer became the jumping-off point for other intense flavors. During its course to completion, 3767 was affected by three different yeast strains--including Brettanomyces, aged for several months in French oak Cabernet Sauvignon barrels, and then bottle- and keg-conditioned. 
The plan is for 3767 to hit Anchorage, Seattle, Portland, San Francisco and San Diego in NOV 2009 for a West Coast Toast. Hereâ€™s to the collaborative spirit readily found in our brewing industry. Clink!"
Cosmic Black Witbier,1,6.2,"Close your eyes. The delicate aroma, flavor, texture of this beer whisper â€œwitbierâ€. Now open your eyes. The color is deceiving. You take another sip.

Big A IPA,1,9.6,"Our Big A IPA has earned its share of praise over the last few years. In 2004 the New York Times named it its top IPA , and in 2007 Mens Journal Magazine included it on its list of 25 best beers in America. The last of each year's edition typically leaves our warehouse around mid-May, and, as always, it doesn't last long. 

Stash Wojciechowski, the â€œKiller Kielbasa,â€ created this bonafide India Pale Ale recipe exclusively for the Smuttynose Big Beer Series."
3rd Anniversary Ale,1,10,
Trickster Belgian-style Pumpkin Ale,1,7,"OK, what do you get when we toss pale malted barley, pumpkin and spices into a stainless steel cauldron then stir in some magic? Uh, Trickster! The â€œmagicâ€ is actually mischievous Belgian yeast at play with cardamom, nutmeg and coriander. This spooky cool brew will make your glass glow bright despite the gloominess of the season. 

Designed to conjure up a little fun during the darkening days of autumn, Trickster is a frivolous concoction of earthy pumpkin, comforting malt, and lively spices. This makes Trickster the brew to accompany your post-winterizing duties, family fall dinners, ghost stories, U-boast-iT stories, and â€œsupposedly hauntedâ€ garage parties. 

But the flavor range of Trickster also pairs well with citrusy and spicy cuisine. Try a glowing glass with your favorite dishes that incorporate nutmeg, cardamom or corianderâ€”like Thai curries, Swedish meatballs, gingerbread, roasted pumpkin soup. Add Trickster to soups and sauces, batters and doughs, glasses and mugs."
Berserker Imperial Stout,1,12.7,"Vicious and viscous, this menacing brew pours opaque black with a creamy maduro-colored head. Its aroma offers seductive whiskey, chewy red wine, dark fruit and lavish tobacco. Berserker Imperial Stout invades your taste buds with in-your-face flavor. Weighing in at almost 13% alcohol by volume, Berserker is completely out-of-control. Give it a good fight.

This version of Berserker Imperial Stout was aged in both red wine and whiskey barrels. The entire batch was brought back together before being packaged in kegs and 22-oz bottles."
Imperial Russian Stout,1,10.5,"Brewed in the authentic historical style of an Imperial Russian Stout, this ale is massive. Intensely aromatic (notes of anise, lack currants, coffee, roastiness and alcohol) and heavy on the palate, this brew goes where few can --- and fewer dare even try. The style originated from Czarist Russia's demand for ever thicker English stouts. Expect our version of this mysterious brew to pour like Siberian crude and taste even heavier!"
Howl,1,4.6,"Born of dark and cold and snow in the marrow of the northeast's longest night, HOWL comes in on wailing winds with winter-weary eyes burning holes in sunless shadows. In its darkened depths out inner voids are warmed."
Whitetail Golden Ale,1,5,"Our golden American ale has a crisp body and slightly dry, hoppy finish. This is a real treat for the beer lover. Pale, wheat and torrified wheat malts are used with Northern Brewer and Mt. Hood hops."
DuganA IPA,1,8.5,"Lupulin Rapture Incarnate! As fervent Â devotees of hops, we found ourselves on a quest to create a transcendental IPA capable of quenching our voracious lupulin desires. Our mantra became \unity of bitterness"
Golf,1,5,"A Brewer's Select Series, Golf is a fest-weisse hybrid or 'Festeweizen.' It will weigh in at 5.0% and is made with Munich, Wheat, and CaraVienna malts and Spalt hops."
Old Salt IPA,1,5.8,Our India Pale Ale is hoppy and bitter with a nice sweet malt finish. Slow dry-hop conditioning brings out the herbal hop aromas.
Cascade Razberry Wheat,1,4.5,Razberry Wheat is crisp with a refreshing tartness and the fresh aroma of raspberries. This salmon pink ale is just the thing to transport you to berry time in the summer.
Celtic Copper Ale,1,5.2,Celtic Copper is a mahogany hued ale with rich malt flavor and subtle hop balance; an excellent choice for those who prefer amber ales.
Ring Tail Pale Ale,1,4.2,"Ring Tail Pale is light in body and straw-gold in color, with a crisp hop finish. This beer is a great choice for domestic lager drinkers."
Bad Billy Blond Bock,1,6.2,Our Blond Bock is gold in color and features a malty profile and a spicy finish courtesy of Saaz hops. This beer boasts the flavor of a traditional Bock without the cloying aftertaste.
Cascade Apricot Ale,1,9,"Features the intense aroma of fresh-picked, slow ripened Northwest apricots warmed by the summer sun. Based on a Belgian Tripel, this beer went through 16 months lactic fermentation and aging in French oak wine barrels."
Cascade Kreik Ale,1,6.6,A Belgian Flanders Style Red Ale refermented with a sweet blend of fresh whole Northwest cherries. This beer spent more than six months of lactic fermentation and aging in small French oak wine barrels before being hand-bottled.
Cascade CuvÃ©e Du Jongleur,1,8.41,"A careful blending of select barrels of Flanders Reds and soured Belgian Triples aged in oak for up to 18 months. Then blended with fresh 25Â° Plato Blond Quadruppel. Hand-bottled, corked and then aged allowing lactic fermentation."
Cascade Sang Royal,1,8.87,"This Northwest style sour red is a bottled version of our popular Mouton Rouge. This blend of barrels, with up to 16 months of oak barrel lactic fermentation and oak barrel aging, features dark fruit, sour, oak and funk flavors that sweep over your taste buds like an incoming tide."
Exit 11 - Hoppy American Wheat,1,6.2,"Exit 11 Hoppy American Wheat Ale is the second in their wildly popular Exit Series of Big Bottle Beers. Exit 11 is a confluence of styles and ingredients, just as Exit 11 is the point in New Jersey where the Garden State Parkway, the New Jersey Turnpike and several other highways come together.

â€œExit 11 is the point on the Turnpike where the Garden State Parkway branches off and takes hundreds of thousands of travelers to the renowned Jersey Shore,â€ says Flying Fish Founder Gene Muller.  â€œOur Exit 11 Wheat Ale is a fresh, citrus-y summer beer perfect for beachgoers and those who only wish they were headed â€˜downa shoreâ€™.â€

Exit 11 is an American-style wheat beer brewed with English ale yeast and three Pacific Northwest hops, Columbus, Palisade and Amarillo.  It is brewed with 50% Belgian pale malt and 50% white wheat, and is an ideal summer thirst quencher, with its bouquet of tangerines and apricots. Exit 11 is available only during this one-time release, and only until it sells out across New Jersey, Pennsylvania and Delaware."
Cucapa Honey Ale,1,4.5,"A Craft Amber Ale, brewed using Honey from Northern Mexico."
Grain Belt,1,4.6,"This beer has changed hands a bit over its 60+ year history - first brewed by the Grain Belt Brewery in Minneapolis, then by the now-defunct Minnesota Brewing and currently by August Schell Brewing Co. in New Ulm."
Scratch #25 2009 Magical Moustache Rye,1,6.5,"This mahogany ale packs a lingering, earthy hoppiness. The addition of more than 20% rye to the grain bill gives a creamy mouthfeel and hints of spice that compliment the bitterness of hops. Subtle fruitiness come through from the Bravo hops added during the boil, but the Cluster and Liberty varieties used in dry-hopping this beer are the true flavor drivers in this spicy ale. Dark in color and intense is flavor, Scratch 25-2009 finds true balance in a beer that could have easily gone way over the top. Enjoy."
Punk IPA,1,6,"This 6% trans-atlantic fusion IPA is light golden in colour with tropical fruits and light caramel on the nose. The palate soon becomes assertive and resinous with the New Zealand hops balanced by the biscuit malt. The finish is aggressive and dry with the hops emerging over the warming alcohol.

This fresh, full flavour natural beer is our tribute to the classic IPAs of yester-year. The post modern twist is the addition of amazing fruity hops giving an explosion of tropical fruit flavours and a sharp bitter finish."
Rip Tide,1,8,"A strong, silky smooth imperial stout with a deep, dark ruby appearance. Mocha, bitter chocolate, liquorice and dark cherry flavours prevail, before the balanced, warming and encapsulating finish.

A contemporary Scottish take on an age old Russian classic style originally brewed for the Tsars. Our interpretation brings together hops from both sides of the Atlantic, amazing flavoured malts and dark sugars.

Like the original BrewDog, this beer would never bite you but would much rather give you a lick on the face. Look Out!

Serving Suggestion: Enjoy with an air of aristocratic nonchalance"
Paradox Speyside,1,10,
The Physics,1,5,
Hop Rocker,1,5.5,
Hardcore IPA,1,9,"This little bottle has a grandiloquent story to tell.

2,204 malted Maris Otter grains gave all they had to offer the world to provide the robustly delicate toffee malt canvas for the ensuing epic.

6 Hop Cones willingly sacrificed themselves in fiery cauldron that is our brew kettle to ensure your mouth is left feeling punished and puckering for more.

9,900,000,000 yeast cells frantically fermented their little hearts out as the sugars were magically turned into alcohol in the dark depths of our fermentation tanks.

This explicit ale has more hops and bitterness that any other beer brewed in the UK. This is an extreme beer rollercoaster for freaks, gypsies and international chess superstars."
Trashy Blonde,1,4.1,"A titillating, neurotic, peroxide, punk of a pale ale. Combining attitude, style substance and a little bit of low self esteem for good measure; what would your mother say?

You really should just leave it alone...

...but you just cant get the compulsive malt body and gorgeous dirty blonde colour out of your head. The seductive lure of the sassy passion fruit hop proves too much to resist. All that is even before we get onto the fact that there are no additives preservatives, pasteurization or strings attached.

All wrapped up with the customary Brewdog bite and imaginative twist. This trashy blonde is going to get you into a lot of trouble."
77 Lager,1,4.9,"A Lager that actually tastes of something?

You have to be kidding, right?

77 lager is made with 100% malt and whole leaf hops.

It contains no preservatives, additives, cheap substitutes or any other junk.

Maybe we are crazy. So what?

Taste 77 Lager and we are pretty sure you will agree that the fine line between genius and insanity has just become a little more blurred."
Dogma,1,7.8,"Dogma is an innovative, enigmatic ale brewed with guarana, poppy seeds and kola nut all blended together with Scottish heather honey. A conspiracy of transcontinental ingredients infused with some devastatingly BrewDog imaginative thinking.

The flavours, intricacies and nuances of this beer are best enjoyed while musing over some obscure 17th Century philosophical meanderings, such as:

\If we disbelieve everything because we cannot certainly know all things we will do much"
Tokyo,1,12,"The irony of existentialism, the parody of being and the inherent contradictions of post-modernism, all so delicately conveyed by the blocky, pixelated arcade action have all been painstakingly recreated in this bottles contents.

This imperial stout is brewed with copious amounts of speciality malts, jasmine and cranberries. After fermentation we then dry-hop this killer stout with a bucketload of our favourite hops before carefully ageing the beer on French toasted oak chips.

It is all about moderation. Everything in moderation, including moderation itself. What logically follows is that you must, from time, have excess. This beer is for those times."
Tokyo*,1,18.2,
Tactical Nuclear Penguin,1,32,"This is the worlds strongest ever beer, ever (yes ever).

No Penguins  were harmed in the making of this beer; some humans did get very, very cold though. It was worth it.

The Antarctic name, inducing schizophrenia, of this Å¸ber-imperial stout originates from the amount of time it spent exposed to extreme cold. This beer was initially double barrel aged for 14 months; maturing in the deep, rich oak of Scottish whisky casks. After this epic maturation the beer was then frozen, then frozen again, then frozen again.

This is an extremely strong beer, it should be enjoyed in small servings and with an air of aristocratic nonchalance. In exactly the same manner that you would enjoy a fine whisky, a Frank Zappa album or a visit from a friendly yet anxious ghost."
Hopsecutioner,1,7.2,"Here ye, here yeâ€¦All hopheads shall herewith rejoice! Terrapin has recruited ye old HOPSECUTIONER to execute the exact hop profile for this killer IPA!"
Terrapin Coffee Oatmeal Imperial Stout,1,8.6,"Black as night, this coffee stout is thick, rich and full of real coffee flavor. Brewed with the Terrapin Wake-n-Bake coffee blend created by Terrapin & Jittery Joeâ€™s Coffee."
BackDraft Chocolate Porter,1,0,
TrÃ¶egs Splinter Beer Red,1,11,"Before filtering the final batch of 2008 Mad Elf we racked some beer into bourbon barrels for six weeks of tender loving care. After bottling, we aged the beer for approximately eight months. This allows the tart cherries to push to the front. Subtle vanilla, bourbon, charred wood, coconut and toasted nut endnotes emanate from Splinter Red."
TrÃ¶egs Splinter Beer Gold,1,12,"The transformation of Scratch #3-2007 to Splinter Gold has been a slow rest in oak wine barrels dosed with brettanomyces. During a two-year aging period the horsy flavors of the brett combined with the Westmalle yeast used during primary fermentation to create a complex blend of flavors. Bone-dry and 12% abv, Splinter Gold is highly carbonated."
Ridge Runner Barley Wine,1,7.5,"â€œRobust, Dark and Smooth, hold on to your hat cause youâ€™ll lose your feet on this one!â€ Brewed with pale, dark crystal, Munich, flaked barley, black and chocolate malts. Hops include Cascade, Crystal, Challenger and Perle."
King Crimson,1,6,
Horizon Red Ale,1,5.7,"A richer shade of Red. Summit has artfully crossed the boundaries of traditional IPA and Amber styles to create a brew all our own. Featuring an aromatic blend of Horizon, Amarillo and Cascade hops with nicely balanced malts for a flavor youâ€™ll enjoy to the fullest."
Winter Ale,1,0,A seasonal winter beer from Brooklyn
Stateside Saison,1,0,"An 'American Farmhouse Ale.' It's a Belgian-inspired brew that uses a combination of European malts, hops from New New Zealand and the United States.. and a classic farmhouse yeast to achieve a fruity, yet spicy, melange of flavors and aroma."
Jai Alai IPA,1,7.5,"Jai Alai IPA is a monster interpretation of an American IPA. In fact, it is so big that it equals the alcohol of some double IPAs on the market. Our IPA uses 6 different hop varietals, with Simcoe hops only being used for dry hopping. The rest of the hop additions are blended at different IBU's (International Bittering Units) in groups of three hops per addition in order to create more hop complexity. At CCB, we love hops but also feel that balance is important for IPAs. So Jai Alai features a sturday caramel malt component which helps to create balance, staving off hop astringency. Ultimately, Jai Alai is a very strong interpretation of a single American IPA. We hope that it makes Tampa Bay natives happy because this is head brewer Wayne Wamble's favorite Cigar City beer and he'd love to share one with you!"
Maduro Oatmeal Brown Ale,1,5.5,"Maduro is a Northern English-style brown ale with some American affectations. It is unlike the typical American Brown Ale, as it doesnâ€™t have the big hop character common in American-brewed Brown Ales. And Maduro is higher in alcohol than the common English brown ale. Maduro also has oats, in the malt bill which imparts a silky body and aids in making the roasted, toasted and chocolate components mesh together in Maduro's complex malt profile. The end result is a remarkably full flavored yet approachable and sessionable brown ale that pairs well with cigars."
Marshal Zhukov's Imperial Stout,1,11,"This Russian Imperial Stout is dedicated to Gregory Zhukov. Arguably one of World War II's finest generals and a man bold enough to appreciate the rich, complex flavors of a beer brewed to fortify a body through the Russian winter. Like military geniuses, Russian Imperial Stouts reach their peak with a little age on them, so we release Marshal Zhukov's Russian Imperial Stout in sweltering August so that it will be at peak flavor come January or February.

Opaque black in color, the aroma has notes of espresso, chocolate, dark sweet toffee with hints of black strap molasses. The flavor starts with an unsweetened chocolate character and supporting notes of herbal dryness from English hop varietals. It then moves into dark toffee sweetness and closes with a slap of roasty espresso. Zhukov's Imperial Stout pairs well with Mushroom Solyanka, dark chocolate, cherries and ground wars in Russia.  Enjoy, comrade."
Guava Grove Ale,1,8,Guava Grove is a Saison which is fermented with guava. The guava adds sweetness and acidity to the prodigious fruity esters imparted by the warm fermentation temperatures  of the Belgian yeast strain.
Big Sound Scotch Ale,1,8.5,"Big Sound Scotch Ale is dedicated to our good buddy Gino, the most punk rock bagpiper you'll ever meet, and the rest of the men and women of Tampa Bay Pipes and Drums. Brown in color, Big Sound has huge notes of dark sweet toffee with underlying mild notes of coffee in the aroma. The flavor starts with a slight note of cherry and then opens into a Goliath of a malt character with notes of dark sweet toffee, slight hints of coffee and mild notes of toasted bread in the finish. Big Sound Scotch Ale pairs well with Haggis, Highland Games, Huge Heads and Enormous Pillows and of course Bagpipe music."
Modus Hoperandi,1,6.8,
JoBoy's IPA,1,6.5,"This is our offering to the hop heads! A decidedly hoppy, bitter, and moderately strong American IPA. We use a generous amount of whole leaf Cascade, Centennial and Citra hops to showcase the freshness and earthy flavors that only hops can provide."
Manheim Stout,1,0,"An intense and rich, dark, roasty ale with substantial alcohol warming. Requires several months of aging."
JoBoy's Cream Ale,1,0,"A crisp, clean, easy drinking, refreshing American ale with a light body."
Divine Reserve 9,1,11,"Important: let this beer warm to at least 50Â° before enjoying.  This beer is black with some ruby highlights.  The nose is full of pumpkin pie spices and some alcohol.  There are notes of nutmeg, caraway and vanilla.  The taste starts with chocolate malt with a hint of spice and rolls into a warm spicy alcohol taste which has the effect of creating the balance that usually comes from the hop bitter.  There is some hop bitter on the finish, but not much.  Overall, this beer finishes relatively dry for such a big beer.  As it warms, the spices move forward in the taste and the chocolate moves to the finish.  The pumpkin provides a pleasant undertone and a nice mouthfeel.  The spices will probably fade some over time; they mellowed considerably while still in the fermenter."
Phoenixx Double ESB,1,7.2,"Our winter seasonal is inspired by the great ales of the UK but brewed with a distinctively American attitude. English crystal malt gives Phoenixx its subtle toffee and caramel notes, but this ale is about hops. The blend of English hops, highlighted by its namesake, Phoenix, yields a complex hop character that dominates this special brew."
(512) Wit,1,5.2,"Made in the style of the Belgian wheat beers that are so refreshing, (512) Wit is a hazy ale spiced with coriander and domestic grapefruit peel. 50% US Organic 2-row malted barley and 50% US unmalted wheat and oats make this a light, crisp ale well suited for any occasion."
(512) Pale,1,5.8,"With Organic 2-row malted barley, (512) Pale is a copper colored American Pale Ale that balances earthy hop bitterness and hop flavor with a rich malty body."
(512) IPA,1,7,"(512) India Pale Ale is a big, aggressively dry-hopped American IPA with smooth bitterness (~65 IBU) balanced by medium maltiness. Organic 2-row malted barley, loads of hops, and great Austin water create an ale with apricot and vanilla aromatics that lure you in for more."
(512) Pecan Porter,1,6.8,"Nearly black in color, (512) Pecan Porter is made with Organic US 2-row and Crystal malts along with Bairdâ€™s Chocolate and Black malts. Its full body and malty sweetness are balanced with subtle pecan aroma and flavor from locally grown pecans. Yet another true Austin original!"
(512) ALT,1,6,"(512) ALT is a German-style amber ale that is fermented cooler than typical ales and cold conditioned like a lager. ALT means â€œoldâ€ in German and refers to a beer style made using ale yeast after many German brewers had switched to newly discovered lager yeast. This ale has a very smooth, yet pronounced, hop bitterness with a malty backbone and a characteristic German yeast character. Made with 98% Organic 2-row and Munch malts and US noble hops."
(512) Bruin,1,7.6,"At once cuddly and ferocious, (512) BRUIN combines a smooth, rich maltiness and mahogany color with a solid hop backbone and stealthy 7.6% alcohol. Made with Organic 2 Row and Munich malts, plus Chocolate and Crystal malts, domestic hops, and a touch of molasses, this brew has notes of raisins, dark sugars, and cocoa, and pairs perfectly with food and the crisp fall air."
(512) Whiskey Barrel Aged Double Pecan Porter,1,8.2,"Our first barrel project is in kegs and on itâ€™s way to beer bars around Austin. This is a bigger, bolder version of our mainstay Pecan Porter, with a richer finish. Two months on recently emptied Jack Daniels select barrels imparted a wonderful vanilla character from the oak and a pleasant amount of whiskey nose and flavor. All in all, Iâ€™m really proud of the hard work and effort put into this beer. Our first attempt at brewing it and our first attempt at managing barrels has paid off for everyone! Seek out this beer, but donâ€™t put it off. There is a very limited number of kegs available and it might go fastâ€¦"
2xIPA,1,0,
Samuel Adams Noble Pils,1,5.2,"Samuel Adams Noble Pils is one of the only brews made with all five Noble hops from the worldâ€™s growing regions. its bright flavor and lively, citrus hop character reminds us that the warm days of spring are just a few weeks away."
Scratch #27 2010 Cocaoabunga,1,6.7,"Scratch #27-2010 begins a new fold in the Scratch series. For the next several batches individual Troegs brewers will create recipes of their choice. First up, The Ticeman had a hankering for a sweet stout, so the Troegs brothers and all the brewers met with Scharffen Berger Chocolate Company engineers to eat ridiculous amounts of cocoa nibs and chocolates over a few pints of beer.

This collaboration resulted in the delivery of a special blend of cocoa nibs that were added during the boiling process. In addition to the nibs, lactose was added at the end of the boil to give a little sweetness in the body. The addition of Galena and Simcoe hops lends a subtle fruity balance. After primary fermentation, the beer was aged for three weeks on a blend of cocoa nibs and Ugandan vanilla beans.

Dubbed Cocaoabunga, this unfiltered beer has a pleasant cocoa aroma, a subtle sweetness in the mouthfeel, a full-bodied flavor, and hints of vanilla. Enjoy!"
Captin Lawrence Pale Ale,1,5.6,"One of the first beers I brewed after moving out to California to begin my brewing education was a Pale Ale. This version is a true testament to the influences the Wild West had on my early brewing. My Pale Ale is loaded with US-grown Cascade, Crystal, and Columbus hops, so be sure to take a good sniff to enjoy their robust aromas before taking your first sip."
Captain Lawrence Xtra Gold,1,10,"This beer is the result of the marriage between two very distinct beer styles; the Belgian Tripel & American IPA. We have taken the best qualities from both styles and allowed them to shine through. The fruity and spicy notes from the imported Belgian yeast strain & the pungent flavors and aromas of the American grown Amarillo hops flow seamlessly together to create this flavorful ale.  Straight from the Captainâ€™s cellar to yours, we hope you enjoy."
Captin Lawrence Liquid Gold,1,6,"Don't let the golden color fool you - this isn't your father's lite beer!

Brewed with imported German malts and US-grown hops, this beer is a full-flavored introduction to craft-brewed beer. We add the hops late in the boil, allowing you to enjoy the flavor and aroma of the hops without an aggressive bitterness."
Captin Lawrence Smoked Porter,1,6.4,"A complex beer, with layers of flavors unfolding as this beer slides down your throat. Before the introduction of indirect-fired malt kilns, all beers had a smoky flavor. Today only a handful of brewers produce beer reminiscent of those of the past. We use imported German smoked malt to add depth and complexity to our Smoked Porter."
Captain's Reserve Imperial IPA,1,9,"This beer is a salute to the ingenuity and creativity of the American craft brewers. A uniquely American style of beer, the Double or Imperial IPA, has become the calling card of many craft brewers who aren't afraid to push the limits of what hops can add to a beer. This beer is big and hoppy - not for the faint of heart! Be prepared to experience sensory overload as you savor this Imperial IPA."
Sun Block - Belgian Style Witte,1,0,"This beer was created as a summer thirst quencher, because we all know how hot and humid it can get in New York during the summer. We brewed this beer using both coriander and orange peel in the boil to increase both the aroma and flavor of this beer. Make sure you donâ€™t get burned this summer, drink your Sun Block."
Brown Bird Brown Ale,1,4.8,"Named after the little birds that fly by the brewery looking for grain after the weather turns cold, this was originally to be a Fall/Winter seasonal. Clearly we underestimated the market for this smooth and malty brown ale, and we have decided to keep it for year round enjoyment."
Nor' Easter,1,12,"This is a truly unique brew, combining some unusual elements to create a powerful, yet flavorful brew. I brewed a similar beer to this one back in 1998, while I was home brewing out in California. Only this time around I decided to age it in bourbon barrels to add a new element to the already rich sensory profile. The combination of dark malt, elderberries and bourbon barrels makes for an interesting tasting experience. This is a sippinâ€™ beer, so sit back by the fire and enjoy. 12% alcohol by volume."
Golden Delicious,1,0,"Thereâ€™s nothing quite likes Momâ€™s apple pieâ€¦But I am willing to bet this beer is pretty darn close.  An American Tripel, dry-hoped with Amarillo hops and aged in Apple Brandy barrels from one of this countryâ€™s oldest distilleries.  The tropical aroma of the hops and the delicate apple aroma from the barrels are a perfect match.  Straight from the Captainâ€™s cellar to yours, we hope you enjoy."
LeBleu,1,5,"Brewed with New York State Blueberries and Brettanomyces, Le Bleu is a blend of barrels filled in 2007, 2008, and 2009. It's finished in the bottle with Champagne yeast.  

Enjoy the dusty rose appearance, mouthwatering aroma of ripe berries, piquant flavor and quick finish."
Canadian Breakfast Stout,1,9.4,
Raging Bitch Belgian IPA,1,8.3,"â€œTwo inflammatory words... one wild drink. Nectar imprisoned in a bottle. Let it out. It is cruel to keep a wild animal locked up. Uncap it. Release it....stand back!! Wallow in its golden glow in a glass beneath a white foaming head. Remember, enjoying a RAGING BITCH, unleashed, untamed, unbridled- and in heat- is pure GONZO!! It has taken 20 years to get from there to here. Enjoy!â€"
Lilja's Hop Nest Monster,1,0,
Mayhem Belgian-style Double IPA,1,8.2,"Chaotic yet hypnotic, Mayhem is a deliberate Double IPA, brewed and conditioned with a special Belgian yeast that contributes complexity and spice. Abundant American hops offer grapefruit, pine, must and mint, which play off the fullness and sweetness of pale malts then provide a biting yet enticing finish.

Mayhem Double IPA accents the complex spice combinations found in Thai, Indian, Cajun, Morrocan, Mexican and Southwest American cuisines as well as BBQ marinades, dry rubs and sauces.

Mayhem creates MAYHEM."
RUMBAH Double Rum Bock,1,10,"Beer Description:
This double bock provides smooth sailin' in rough seas. The fact that this luscious lager was aged in rum barrels creates the illusion that the open sea is a safe place. And while riding out these waves of grain, you may fall victim to the dangers of pirates, rum, bock. OK...maybe the beach is a bit over-rated."
Bathtub Gin Gruit Ale,1,8,"This gruit ale was inspired by the Phish song of the same name. A traditional gruit in style, Bathtub Gin was brewed without hops. Instead Ben spiced his beer with botanicals typically used to flavor gin: juniper berries, orris root, angelica root, grains of paradise, lemon peel, orange peel and coriander. The result is intensely fragrant, flavorful and fabulous."
Farmer's Tan Imperial Pale Lager,1,9,"Neolithic humans evolved from nomadic hunters into a more settled agricultural society, changing life forever. The â€˜founderâ€™ crops they raised included wheat and barley. It is little surprise that the first examples of brewing appeared during this age.

Brewers owe much to the epoch. Similarly, we thank our farmer friends of today for cultivating the ingredients the are responsible for the beers we now enjoy. Their laborious days spent ourdoors under the hot sun earn them respect, as well as a mark of distinction: the farmer's tan. Yes, the inevitable red and white hallmark of hard work."
Weyerbacher India,1,7.2,"The latest in our Brewersâ€™ Select One-offs, India is a West Coast style IPA at [7.2%] ABV, with incredibly delicious hoppiness! Golden in color, this beer is tilted way over toward the hops by way of less specialty malts used in the mash. Draft will be going out to select wholesalers in PA, NJ, FL, and MD.â€ 70+ IBUâ€™s."
Scumptious Spring Lager (Vinyl),1,0,Magic Hat's seasonal Lager is also called Vinyl
Squall IPA,1,9,"An unfiltered and 100% bottle-conditioned version of 90 Minute IPA that's dry-hopped with Palisade, Amarillo, Simcoe, Cascade, CTZ, and Willamette hops. Brewed to honor the Rogue Gallery in Portland, Maine, who will also be releasing a DFH designed clothing line in the summer of '09."
Glacier Harvest '09 Wet Hop (100 Barrel Series #28),1,6.7,"For the 28th session of the Harpoon 100 Barrel Series, weâ€™re celebrating this yearâ€™s hop harvest with Glacier Harvest Wet Hop beer, a pale ale made with fresh Glacier hops.
 
Wet hop beers are brewed using fresh, â€œwetâ€ hops instead of traditional dried hopsâ€”hops contain about 60% moisture when they are first picked.

Typically, when hops are picked they are quickly dried and refrigerated to increase shelf life and make them more consistent for brewing. Freshly picked wet hops, however, need to be used within hours of harvest or they will begin to degrade rapidly. Wet hops retain more of their natural aroma and volatile flavors that dissipate when dried. This gives wet hop beers a fresher hop flavor and aroma than that of beers hopped with processed hops.
This yields an immersed, intense hop flavor in the beer.

Harpoon brewer Ray Dobens, creator of the beer, added a heroic dose of fresh hops the day of the harvest.The hop flavor and aroma from this copper-colored ale comes from a generous late addition of freshly harvested â€œwetâ€ hops."
Michelob Irish Red,1,0,"Born of Irish tradition, this all-malt ale uses kilned and toasted malts to produce its all-natural, signature red shade. A beer with exceptional balance, Irish Red displays an initial sweetness that fades to a clean, dry finish."
Lucky 13 Mondo Large Red Ale,1,8.3,"Our 13th Anniversary Beer in was a Staff Favorite, So We Make it Each Year. BIG on the Amarillo Hops and Rich Dark Malts for a Round and Huge, Smoky Flavor."
Buried Hatchet Stout,1,8.25,"Jet-black in color, this monster smells of coffee and chocolate.  The taste is much of the same, with hints of creamy toffee and roasted malt.  Smooth and delicious, this medium bodied ale is all about the malts, but has enough hop bitterness to be balanced."
Vigneronne,1,5,"The name Vigneronne Cantillon was given in 1987. This name reminds us that, while it belongs to the beer patrimony, the spontaneous fermentation, the ageing in the barrels for several years and the addition of grapes make it a distant cousin of certain white wines.

In spite of its success, the Vigneronne represents less than 5% of the total production of the Cantillon brewery.

Exit 16 - Wild Rice Double IPA,1,8.2,"The fourth stop on our multi-year trip to explore New Jersey takes us to one of the most maligned places in the state- the Hackensack Meadowlands. Itâ€™s the place usually identified with landfills, pipelines, mob burials (alleged) and sports teams that say theyâ€™re from New York.

Although no longer home to forests of giant cedars and salt hay marshes teeming with aquatic life, the Meadowlands is still an amazingly diverse ecosystem providing vital animal and plant habitat. In a nod to a once common food plant here, weâ€™ve brewed this beer with wild rice. We also used brown and white rice, as well as two malts.

Rice helps the beer ferment dry to better showcase the five different hops weâ€™ve added. Lots and lots of them. We then dry-hopped this Double IPA with even more-generous additions of Chinook and Citra hops to create a nose that hints at tangerine, mango, papaya and pine."

Little Scrapper IPA,1,6,"To admit that the brewer at Half Pints is a bit of a hophead is an understatement. This India Pale Ale is unabashedly hoppy, not only from the Amarillo hops we add to the brew kettle, but also from the northwest U.S. variety called Cascade that we add directly to the final tank. A firm toasted malt presence forms the background for all of these hops, and we're confident our Little Scrapper IPA could take other so-called IPA's to the mat if called upon to do so. Try it with a curry or a basket of beer battered fish & chips. Serve in a glass at 8 degrees celcius. Unpasturized."

Honey Rye Ale,1,0,"This beer is not very bitter which allows the flavors of the rye and honey to come through. The result is a full bodied, sweet, and malty beer."
Strawberry,1,0,Strawberry Harvest Lager is a wheat beer made with real Louisiana strawberries.
Satsuma Wit,1,0,This Wit beer has a sweet and subtle citrus flavor with a touch of spice that is cool and refreshing.
